Pelosi's visit to Taiwan is a serious violation of the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiqu\u00c3\u00a9s. It has a severe impact on the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, seriously infringes on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. side has kept challenging China's bottom line and undermining China's core interests, leading to constant escalation of tension. The current situation is entirely caused by the U.S. side. The U.S. must bear full responsibility. It was the U.S. side who played with the fire and made the provocations first, and China has been compelled to act in self-defense. China's move is legitimate, justified and lawful. Instead of holding the U.S. to account, the G7 has called on China to remain calm and exercise restraint. This is blatant gangster logic. The world today is not the time when the Eight-Power Allied Forces ran riot. For centuries the Western aggressors could occupy another country simply by setting up a few cannons on a coast in the East. But gone forever are those days. Whoever damages China's national interests must pay the price!\n\nXie Feng pointed out that the G7 statement is like a thief crying \"Stop thief!\". It blatantly tramples underfoot the basic norms governing international relations. While keeping talking about being committed to \"maintaining the rules-based international order\", the G7 has wantonly violated the international law and basic norms governing international relations that have the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries at their core, and has breached the one-China principle that has been affirmed by the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, unequivocally committed to by 181 countries in the world, and universally observed by the international community. Pelosi is a saboteur of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, a saboteur of China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, and a saboteur of international peace, stability and development. What Pelosi has done is not only a provocation to the Chinese people, but also a challenge to peace-loving forces in the international community. The G7 countries know these full well. Why do they lie through their teeth and shift blame?\n\nXie Feng stressed that Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. China's resolve to uphold national sovereignty and territorial integrity is unswerving. So is China's resolve to oppose external interference in China's internal affairs. Any conspiracy to condone and support the separatist forces for \"Taiwan independence\" is doomed to failure. More than 100 countries and international organizations, including the United Nations, have reiterated their support for the one-China principle. The G7, in no way, represents the international community. The G7 countries should clearly recognize the overall trend and not stand against the 1.4 billion Chinese people, against the majority of countries in the world and against international justice. China urges the Canadian side to immediately correct its mistakes, respect facts, distinguish right from wrong, stop following and participating in bloc confrontation, and stop taking wrong moves on Taiwan-related issues. Otherwise, all consequences shall be borne by the Canadian side.\n\n", "id": "0b18540197ba38b09303ab07d80ec9be"}

The Foreign Ministry has resolutely implemented the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping, and worked together with various departments and local governments to guide embassies and consulates in Sudan and neighboring countries to organize the safe and orderly evacuation of a large number of people from Khartoum and other conflict-stricken areas in a short period of time. The People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Liberation Army (PLA) urgently dispatched warships that were on escort missions in the Gulf of Aden to Sudan to carry out the evacuation operation. As of now, more than 1,100 Chinese compatriots, including residents from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, have been safely evacuated from Sudan. China is the country that has evacuated the largest number of people by organized evacuations since the outbreak of internal conflicts in Sudan. China, upholding the vision of a human community with a shared future, also actively helped with the safe evacuation of foreign nationals.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur compatriots have boarded Chinese warships and embarked on the journey home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082said Wu Xi, noting that serving the people is the fundamental purpose of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diplomacy. The staff of the Centre for Consular Assistance and Protection\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the Foreign Ministry has worked around the clock for more than ten days to coordinate and organize emergency evacuation operations. Braving risks, comrades at the Chinese Embassy in Sudan meticulously organized the evacuation and opened up \u00e2\u0080\u009clife channels\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The PLA rushed to the aid promptly upon orders.

The following are the main points of his speech:\n\nRecently, Pakistan was hit by severe floods\u00e2\u0080\u0082rarely seen in recent years in terms of scale, extent of devastation and long-term impact.\n\nThe Chinese side, sympathetic with what the Pakistani people have gone through, has provided timely assistance to the country. On August 29, President Xi Jinping sent a message of condolence to President Arif Alvi. The compassionate and powerful message says that \"As all-weather strategic cooperative partners and 'ironclad' friends, China and Pakistan have long been sharing weal and woe, rendering mutual assistance, and standing shoulder to shoulder in dealing with natural calamities and other major challenges. When floods\u00e2\u0080\u0082hit Pakistan this time, China acted promptly to provide aid, and will continue to provide much-needed assistance\u00e2\u0080\u0082to support Pakistan's disaster relief work\". Premier Li Keqiang also sent a message of condolence to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Acting upon the instruction of Chinese leaders, the Chinese side has promptly pledged assistance, contacted the Pakistani side to coordinate its delivery, and sent military aircraft to deliver tents and other urgently needed relief materials. Follow-up actions to support Pakistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disaster relief and post-disaster reconstruction effort are well underway.\n\nChina's assistance is all-dimensional, and involves\u00e2\u0080\u0082the whole of\u00e2\u0080\u0082government and \u00e2\u0080\u0082society. The Chinese people have actively donated money and materials to the disaster-hit areas of Pakistan. A few hours after the Pakistani Embassy in China opened a dedicated bank account for Prime Minister's Flood Relief Fund 2022, it received a large number of donations. A Chinese schoolboy named Luan Mingxuan even donated all his pocket money. Each story is an illustration of great love, and each act of kindness is done with utmost sincerity. They are exactly what the Chinese idiom has described as \"supporting each other through thick and thin\", and have proven what the Urdu proverb has said that \"walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light\". They also fully testify to the fact that China and Pakistan are a community with a shared future and brothers sharing weal and woe.\n\n\n\nA prominent feature of China's assistance to Pakistan this time is that China's institutional strengths of pooling resources to accomplish\u00e2\u0080\u0082major tasks\u00e2\u0080\u0082has been brought into play. Sub-national governments and social organizations have been encouraged to take active actions and leverage their special advantages to form synergy with the central government in providing relief supplies. So far, 12 Chinese provinces and cities have extended a helping hand to our Pakistani brothers. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic in\u00e2\u0080\u0082Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, drivers\u00e2\u0080\u0082have worked against time to\u00e2\u0080\u0082transport donated quilts, coats, tents and other winter supplies through the Khunjerab Pass\u00e2\u0080\u0082to\u00e2\u0080\u0082neighboring Gilgit-Baltistan region, and to bring\u00e2\u0080\u0082to people in various parts of Pakistan onions and tomatoes which are essential to their daily life. With Tianjin being Karachi's\u00e2\u0080\u0082sister city, the people of Tianjin are very concerned about the safety and well-being of the people in Karachi as well as\u00e2\u0080\u0082other parts of Pakistan. Cherishing the friendship, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, feel\u00e2\u0080\u0082the urgency of helping Pakistani people\u00e2\u0080\u0082out. Responding quickly and effectively, the Foreign Affairs Office of Tianjin Municipal People's Government, has mobilized, in the shortest possible time, large quantities of cash and materials urgently needed by the Pakistani side such as tents, lights, towel blankets, food, and feed. Under the coordination of the Pakistani Embassy in China and the assistance of people of all sectors, they will be delivered to the affected people as soon as possible.\n\nAs President Xi Jinping has put it, friendship derives from close contact between the people, and holds the key to sound state-to-state relations. Tianjin's action of love epitomizes the strong public support for the ironclad friendship between China and Pakistan. It is also one of the best practices of China's sub-national governments supporting and participating in the country's overall diplomacy, and contributing to high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and promotion of people-to-people connectivity. We are confident\u00e2\u0080\u0082that the relief supplies from Tianjin and other provinces and cities of China will be delivered to our brothers and sisters in Pakistan at the earliest possible time\u00e2\u0080\u0082to bring them warmth and strength. We are confident that\u00e2\u0080\u0082under the leadership of the Pakistani government and with the efforts of all sectors in Pakistan and the support of the international community, the affected population in Pakistan will prevail over the disaster and rebuild their homes at an early date. We are confident that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor will\u00e2\u0080\u0082surly\u00e2\u0080\u0082bear fruitful results, the China-Pakistan cooperation will beat all odds and evil forces, and the ironclad China-Pakistan friendship will stand all the tests and be further strengthened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00bb\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u00bb\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u00bb\n\nDirector of the Foreign Affairs Office of Tianjin Municipal People's Government Luan Jianzhang, Pakistani Ambassador to China Moin ul Haque, Mayor of Karachi Murtaza Wahab, and Deputy Director of the Department of Asian and African Affairs of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries Ji Yongjun attended and addressed the ceremony. Director Luan Jianzhang said that China's assistance to Pakistan is another example that \"when one side is in trouble, help pours in from all sides\". He said that the disaster will eventually come to an end, and \"after the storm comes the rainbow\". Ambassador Haque said that Pakistan is highly grateful for Tianjin's support, which will give a strong boost to Pakistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disaster rescue and relief effort. At the end of the event, Director Luan Jianzhang announced the formal departure of the shipment to Pakistan. These supplies will be delivered to the disaster-stricken areas as soon as possible to help the affected population tide over the difficult time.\n\n\n\n", "id": "183d7cb7f296316c92af19ab0d1cd598"}

{"date": "2022-09-02", "title": "Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng: All Parties Should Accurately Interpret and Apply UNCLOS in Its Entirety and in Good Faith", "content": "\n\nOn September 1, 2022, Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng made a keynote report at \u00e2\u0080\u009cUNCLOS at 40: Retrospect and Prospect\u00e2\u0080\u009d, an international conference marking the 40th anniversary of the opening for the signature of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). He said that at present, global transformation unseen in a century is evolving at an accelerated pace, and new global maritime issues keep emerging. We must accurately interpret and apply UNCLOS in its entirety and in good faith, oppose the distortion and abuse of UNCLOS, reject the practice of double standards, and discard the mindset of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmight is right\u00e2\u0080\u009d. We should strengthen international cooperation, balance marine environmental protection and utilization, and take credible steps to raise developing countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to learn about, utilize and protect the sea and participate in global maritime governance.\n\nXie Feng said that we need to faithfully uphold the purposes and principles of UNCLOS. UNCLOS gives due regard for the sovereignty of all States and aims to promote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans and realize a just and equitable international economic order. UNCLOS has established important principles including peaceful uses of the seas, freedom of the high seas and the international seabed as the common heritage of mankind. All parties should follow the purposes and principles of UNCLOS, fulfill their obligations under the Convention in good faith, reject the law of the jungle at sea, and oppose the attempt to threaten other countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sovereignty and security by using the sea.\n\nXie Feng stressed that we need to strictly abide by the regime on navigation stipulated in UNCLOS. According to UNCLOS, foreign ships enjoy innocent passage in the territorial sea, but such passage shall not be prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State. They enjoy freedom of navigation in the exclusive economic zone, but shall have due regard to the coastal State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sovereign rights and jurisdiction over natural resources. All parties enjoy freedom of navigation in the high seas, but must comply with such requirements as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe high seas shall be reserved for peaceful purposes\u00e2\u0080\u009d. All parties should fully abide by the provisions of UNCLOS in letter and spirit. Even if one is not a State Party to UNCLOS, it should not underscore only their navigation rights while ignoring the legitimate rights and interests of coastal States. There have never been navigation problems in the sea areas under China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jurisdiction. The attempts to misinterpret the regime on sea areas established by UNCLOS and play up the so-called freedom of navigation issues are driven purely by ill intentions. China always actively guarantees and safeguards the navigation rights of all countries according to international law, but firmly opposes certain country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move to threaten China's sovereignty and security in the name of freedom of navigation.\n\nXie Feng also pointed out that we need to accurately apply the dispute settlement mechanism of UNCLOS in good faith. The parties to a dispute are the owners of the dispute settlement procedures. Only when the procedures are approved and accepted by the parties concerned, can they be truly effective in settling the dispute. All parties concerned and international institutions should honor the principle of State consent, act in line with the realities of the dispute among regional countries, accurately apply the dispute settlement procedures in good faith, and must not overstep or abuse their mandate. China always maintains that maritime disputes should be resolved through negotiation and consultation between countries directly concerned. By not accepting or recognizing the so-called award of the South China Sea arbitration, China aims to uphold the authority and integrity of UNCLOS.\n\n", "id": "18ef729e1b2c323f85a5a9ba06ef6f77"}

At the same time, people in all countries are more keen on pursuing peace, development and cooperation, and emerging markets and developing countries are more resolved to seek strength through unity. Protectionist moves will boomerang; anyone attempting to form exclusive blocs will end up isolating himself; maximum sanctions serve nobody's interest. We must get a good grasp of the overarching development trend in the world, firm up confidence, and act in unison and with great motivation to promote global development. These important observations are also of great significance for the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan. The Chinese side hopes that the Afghan side will actively participate in the Belt and Road Initiative, Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping, and synergize such initiatives with Afghanistan's national development plan, so as to inject inexhaustible impetus into the country's economic reconstruction.\n\nLiu Jinsong stressed that China and its neighbors, including Afghanistan, are in a community with a shared future. \"A close neighbor can be more helpful than a distant relative.\" Since the changes in the Afghan situation last year, China has provided a large amount of humanitarian and development assistance in a timely manner to help Afghanistan tide over difficulties and realize economic reconstruction. With China's active efforts, Afghanistan's distinctive agricultural products such as pine nuts, saffron, dried apricots, figs and raisins have been exported to China successfully. In the first five months of this year, Afghanistan exported 200 tons of pine nuts to China, generating 2.8 million U.S. dollars for the Afghan people. So far, 81 Afghan pine nut enterprises have been registered in China. Going forward, China is ready to work with Afghanistan to earnestly implement the consensus reached at the high-level meetings between the two countries and the outcomes of the third Foreign Ministers' Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan, speed up the return of the Afghan students to China for their studies, the resumption of direct flights and the visa application of Afghan businessmen to China and other issues of concern to Afghanistan, and support cooperation between sister provinces and regions at the sub-national level. The Chinese side hopes that the Afghan side will take concrete measures to crack down on terrorist forces, including the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, and protect the safety of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Afghanistan. The Chinese side also hopes that the Afghan side will keep to good neighborliness and constantly improve its relations with neighboring countries, so as to create favorable conditions for Afghanistan to carry out or participate in major connectivity projects in the region.\n\nLiu Jinsong pointed out that there are two sayings in Afghanistan. One is that \"you cannot wake up someone who is only pretending to be asleep.\" The U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan has brought huge disasters to the Afghan people and its irresponsible withdrawal has created more problems for Afghanistan. The United States has not seriously reflected on and apologized for this, but has been constantly scapegoating and shifting blame to others. The United States froze Afghanistan's national assets, including foreign exchange reserves, and imposed unilateral sanctions, making the current plight worse for the Afghan people. The other is that \"the one that suits you well will serve you well.\" Facts have proved that the political and economic model transplanted by the United States does not work in Afghanistan. The Afghan people should seize the historic opportunity of running their own country, actively explore a development model suited to their national conditions and the trend of the times, and embark on the path of sustainable development at an early date with self-reliance as the mainstay and foreign assistance as the supplement.\n\nChina's National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Natural Resources and General Administration of Customs introduced the working progress in supporting Afghanistan's economic reconstruction from their respective areas of competence and suggested holding a meeting of the China-Afghanistan Joint Economic and Trade Committee as soon as possible to discuss the signing of bilateral investment protection and trade facilitation agreement. In doing so, it will provide technical support for Afghanistan's agricultural development and expand the export of high-quality Afghan agricultural products to China.\n\nZakir Jalaly said, the United States' 20-year presence in Afghanistan has seriously restricted the development of Afghanistan, and left a mess behind after its hasty withdrawal. The Afghan interim government is making every effort to improve its governance measures in various fields, actively respond to people's needs, improve the security situation, and enhance self-reliance capability. China is Afghanistan's most important neighbor and largest trading partner. China is also a major country that is sincere in helping Afghanistan. Afghanistan has always benefited from its cooperation with China. Afghanistan appreciates the practical measures taken by China to support the country's economic reconstruction. The Afghan side is willing to actively participate in the Belt and Road cooperation and give play to its geographical advantages and development potential. The Afghan side attaches importance to and understands China's concerns in the field of security and counter-terrorism, and will never allow any force to use Afghan territory to infringe on China's interests, and will practically protect the safety of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and Ministry of Economy introduced their aspirations for cooperation in relevant fields respectively, and look forward to deepening practical cooperation with China in agriculture, economy and trade, energy, mining, health, finance, culture and people-to-people exchanges, capacity building and other fields.\n\n", "id": "23fb28d6c7ef3c12b8ab53ed2e19271e"}

Let me also extend my congratulations to the newly-elected Chairs of the three Main Committees. I assure you my delegation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full support to your work.\n\nHaving withstood the vicissitudes of the international landscape over the last 50-plus years, the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) has become the cornerstone of the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and a vital component of the post-war international security system.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nToday, we live in a world where profound changes and the COVID-19 pandemic, both unseen in a century, are intertwined. The specter of Cold War mentality is there to stay, and the outdated approach to security based on military alliances has resurfaced. Driven by the obsession with so-called major-power strategic competition, the global strategic security environment continues to deteriorate, and risks of arms race and conflicts are growing. As a result, the international non-proliferation regime represented by the NPT is significantly strained and even faces new and the most severe challenges since the end of the Cold War.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nIt is incumbent on all of us to take this Review Conference as an opportunity to uphold the authority and effectiveness of the NPT, promote the three pillars of nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy in a balanced manner, in a bid to breathe new life into the NPT in promoting world peace and development. To this end, China proposes the following:\n\nFirst, we need to uphold the concept of common security in advancing international nuclear disarmament. China is firmly committed to the path of peaceful development and a nuclear strategy of self-defense, and undertakes not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. While firmly safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, China always keeps its nuclear capability at the minimum level required for safeguarding national security. We never compete with any country on the input, quantity or scale of its nuclear capability, nor do we participate in any form of nuclear arms race with any other country. With a high level of stability, consistency and predictability, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear policy in itself is an important contribution to the international nuclear disarmament endeavor.\n\nThe principles of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaintaining global strategic stability\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cundiminished security for all\u00e2\u0080\u009d should be followed in the practices of nuclear disarmament. The countries with the largest nuclear arsenals should further conduct significant and substantive reduction in their nuclear arsenals in a verifiable, irreversible and legally binding manner. This will create conditions for other nuclear-weapon States to join the nuclear disarmament process.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nNuclear-weapon States need to work together to reduce nuclear risks. On January 3rd this year, the leaders of China, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom and France issued a Joint Statement, stressing that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought, and reaffirming that none of their nuclear weapons are targeted at each other or at any other State. This historic statement is helpful in enhancing mutual trust among major countries, preventing nuclear wars, and avoiding an arms race.\n\nOn that basis, the five nuclear-weapon States need to further strengthen communication on strategic stability, and conduct in-depth dialogue on reducing the role of nuclear weapons in their national security doctrines and on a broad range of issues, including missile defense, outer space, cyberspace, and artificial intelligence. Nuclear-weapon States should also strengthen dialogue with non-nuclear-weapon States to enhance mutual understanding and support.\n\nSecond, we need to adhere to the direction of political settlement in addressing the challenges of nuclear-proliferation. All parties concerned should stay committed to bringing the JCPOA back on track at an early date through diplomatic negotiations, and reject the practices of pressuring with sanctions and threat of force. The U.S. should completely lift its relevant illegal sanctions on Iran and long-arm jurisdiction measures on third parties. On that basis, Iran should return to full compliance with its nuclear commitments.\n\nThe international community should reject double standards in the area of non-proliferation. The nuclear-powered submarine cooperation among the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia poses severe nuclear proliferation risks, in contravention of the object and purpose of the NPT. The review conference should conduct in-depth discussions on its implications in all aspects, including its challenges to the IAEA safeguards system, in order to\u00e2\u0080\u0082 firmly uphold the international non-proliferation regime.\n\nThe security situation on the Korean Peninsula remains complex and severe. We need to follow the dual track approach and the principle of phased and synchronized actions in advancing the process towards the establishment of a peace mechanism and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe so-called nuclear sharing arrangements run counter to the provisions of the NPT and increase the risks of nuclear proliferation and nuclear conflicts. The United States should withdraw all its nuclear weapons from Europe and refrain from deploying nuclear weapons in any other region. The relevant non-nuclear-weapon States should earnestly fulfill their NPT obligations and their own commitments, stop instigating nuclear sharing or other forms of nuclear deterrence arrangements. Any attempt to replicate the NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear sharing model in the Asia-Pacific region would undermine regional strategic stability and would be firmly opposed by the countries in the region and, when necessary, face severe countermeasures.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nThe establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones is conducive to attaining the goal of nuclear non-proliferation. The international community should make every endeavor to support the establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction. Nuclear-weapon States should sign and ratify all the relevant protocols to the nuclear-weapons-free zone treaties as early as possible, including the Central Asia Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons. China is willing to take the lead in signing the Protocol to the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone.\n\nThird, we need to commit to the fundamental goal of common development and promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The international community should support the IAEA in playing a central role, increase funding and technological support for developing countries, fully unleash the potential of nuclear energy and nuclear technology in addressing climate change and promoting green development, and contribute to faster implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. All parties should take this Review Conference as an opportunity to jointly map out a new blueprint for promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nWe must take a balanced approach towards non-proliferation and peaceful uses. Some countries seek to create divisions along ideological lines, stretch the concept of national security, abuse multilateral export control regime, and even attempt to create a new version of the Coordinating Committee for Export to Communist Countries, all in the name of non-proliferation. We must resolutely reject such practices, which go against the trend of the times, disrupt normal international cooperation, and harm the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nNuclear safety and security is the lifeline of nuclear energy development and nuclear technology application. The peaceful uses of nuclear energy should not come at the expense of the natural environment and human health. Japan should seriously respond to the legitimate concerns of its neighbouring countries and the international community at large regarding the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident, fully consult with the stakeholders and the relevant international agencies, in order to find an appropriate solution to dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nMr. President,\n\nWe humanity are living in an indivisible security community. Cold War mentality would only wreck the global peace framework. Hegemonism and power politics would only endanger world peace. And bloc confrontation would only exacerbate security challenges in the 21st century. This April, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed a Global Security Initiative at the opening ceremony of the Annual Conference of the Boao Forum for Asia. This initiative highlights the necessity to stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, to giving due regard to the legitimate security concerns of all countries, to upholding the principle of indivisible security and building a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture. Guided by this initiative,China is ready to join hands with all countries to continuously strengthen the universality, authority and effectiveness of the NPT, to inject stability and certainty into this era of turbulence and transformation, and make new contribution to world peace, stability and prosperity.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nTo conclude, I wish this conference a great success.\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\n", "id": "2dac89347a4c3478a630c147fcb96738"}

An Overview of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction\n\nII. Exercise and Expansion of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction\n\nIII. The Perils of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction\n\nConclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe United States has a longstanding practice of exerting frequent long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, including both its allies and countries with which it has hostile or strained relations. In recent years, the practice has kept expanding in scope, with U.S. \"arms\" stretching longer and longer. Examining cases of U.S. abuse of long-arm jurisdiction, this report lays bare the severe harm it has done to the international political and economic order and the international rule of law.\n\nI. An Overview of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086According to U.S. domestic law, long-arm jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over persons or entities domiciled or resident outside the territory of the sanctioning state. First established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington (1945), long-arm jurisdiction allows state courts to exercise in personam jurisdiction in civil and commercial cases where jurisdiction cannot be exercised because the defendant is not domiciled in the state, on the basis that the defendant has some \"minimum contacts\" with the state.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086According to international law, the exercise of a country's jurisdiction over an extraterritorial person or entity generally requires that the person or entity or its conduct has a real and sufficient connection to that country. Yet the U.S. exercises long-arm jurisdiction on the basis of the \"minimum contacts\" rule, constantly lowering the threshold for application. Even the flimsiest connection with the United States, such as having a branch in the United States, using U.S. dollar for clearing or other financial services, or using the U.S. mail system, constitutes \"minimum contacts.\"\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086To exercise long-arm jurisdiction, the United States has further developed the \"effects doctrine,\" meaning that jurisdiction may be exercised whenever an act occurring abroad produces \"effects\" in the United States, regardless of whether the actor has U.S. citizenship or residency, and regardless of whether the act complies with the law of the place where it occurred. The United States has also been expanding the scope of its long-arm jurisdiction to exert disproportionate and unwarranted jurisdiction over extraterritorial persons or entities, enforcing U.S. domestic laws on extraterritorial non-US persons or entities, and wantonly penalizing or threatening foreign companies by exploiting their reliance on dollar-denominated businesses, the U.S. market or U.S. technologies.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In essence, long-arm jurisdiction is an arbitrary judicial practice, wielded by the U.S. government on the strength of its national power and financial hegemony, to enforce extraterritorial jurisdiction over entities and individuals of other countries on the ground of its domestic law.\n\nII. Exercise and Expansion of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In the many years of exercising such jurisdiction, the United States has gradually developed a massive, mutually reinforcing and interlocking legal system for long-arm jurisdiction, and continued to lower the threshold and expand its discretionary power, thus shaping long-arm jurisdiction into a tool for the United States to advance hegemonic diplomacy and pursue economic interests. Such practice disregards other countries' sovereignty, blatantly meddles in others' internal affairs, seriously damages the legitimate interests of other countries, and disrupts the normal order of international exchanges. The expansion of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is all-dimensional. Citing the \"minimum contacts\" rule and the \"effects doctrine,\" the United States has developed massive and complex legal and enforcement systems to support its long-arm jurisdiction which is expanding in scope and fields of application.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Long-arm jurisdiction has also become a means by which the United States abuses unilateral sanctions, especially secondary sanctions. To ensure the extraterritorial effects of U.S. sanction laws, the United States would usually exercise judicial authority to hold extraterritorial entities and individuals accountable for failing to comply with U.S. sanction laws. In addition to long-arm jurisdiction, administrative, economic, financial and other means would also be employed to implement its secondary sanctions.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Compulsory extraterritorial evidence collection is another important means of long-arm jurisdiction. In the judicial process involving other countries, the United States frequently takes unilateral compulsory measures to collect evidence outside its own territory, circumventing normal channels of judicial and law enforcement cooperation between countries. It would directly ask banks and Internet firms that have branches or are listed in the United States to provide evidence such as account information and data located outside the United States. When other countries try to raise d\u00c3\u00a9marche, the United States would always respond by citing excuses such as \"judicial independence\" or \"low efficiency in normal judicial assistance or law enforcement cooperation.\" These typical examples of long-arm jurisdiction have severely damaged other countries' judicial sovereignty, and the legitimate rights and interests of those subjects of evidence collection.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The United States has put in place a whole-of-government system to practice long-arm jurisdiction, which features a division of labor among departments and inter-agency collaboration. The President and Congress are the main decision makers when it comes to sanctions. The President decides on most of the economic sanctions, and Congress participates through legislative activities under specific circumstances. At the heart of sanctions enforcement is the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), an agency under Treasury responsible for freezing assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction, formulating and adjusting lists of sanctioned individuals and entities, and reviewing and issuing licenses. The Department of State's Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation (SPI) is responsible for developing and implementing foreign policy-related sanctions. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), an agency of the Department of Commerce, administers separate lists from the OFAC. On top of these, the U.S. government bolsters its sanctions enforcement through control of SWIFT and CHIPS, two major cross-border payment and clearing systems, by pressing them, when it deems necessary, to cut off contact with the financial institutions of the subject country to achieve the purpose of economic sanctions.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The United States has stepped up legislation for long-arm jurisdiction. A wide range of laws in the United States advance long-arm jurisdiction, including Trading with the Enemy Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and Helms-Burton Act. Others such as the USA PATRIOT Act and National Defense Authorization Act contain long-arm jurisdiction clauses. A number of presidential executive orders also involve long-arm jurisdiction. More and more U.S. federal legislation contains long-arm jurisdiction clauses to prevent Americans from circumventing U.S. laws by establishing subsidiaries in foreign countries, or foreigners enjoying less restrictions than Americans, or relevant international rules-making hurting U.S. interests. These legislative moves allow the United States to enforce long-arm jurisdiction in its diplomacy by citing domestic laws.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086There is a growing tendency of the U.S. applying long-arm jurisdiction to criminal cases, which is an extreme abuse of the practice. In recent years, a number of U.S. federal laws include extraterritorial clauses, which have been exploited by the Department of Justice to launch criminal investigations and prosecutions. In these proceedings, federal courts begin to apply the concept of long-arm jurisdiction when examining the basis of their jurisdiction by broadly interpreting the connection between the case and the United States, expanding the scope of personal and territorial jurisdiction, and lowering the threshold for the application of protective jurisdiction and general jurisdiction.\n\nIII. The Perils of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The United States is the only sanctions superpower in the world. According to the Treasury 2021 Sanctions Review, by fiscal year 2021,the number of active U.S. sanctions designations had increased to more than 9,400.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Sanctions strain relations between countries and undermine the international order. Healthy state-to-state relations are the bedrock for peace and stability in the international order. In the 1990s, the United States introduced the Helms-Burton Act to impose economic sanctions through long-arm jurisdiction on individuals and entities worldwide conducting transactions with Cuba. It sparked strong opposition from the European Union, who in 1996 passed the Blocking Statute to neutralize through legislation the effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction within the EU, and enable individuals and entities in the EU to sue individuals and entities in the United States. Apart from this, the EU put forward a series of proposals and initiatives at the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, the World Trade Organization and other international bodies, calling on the international community to pay attention to the harmful effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction, and even resorted to the WTO dispute settlement procedures. So far, the \"long arm\" of U.S. jurisdiction has reached China, Russia, Iran, Syria, the DPRK, Cuba, France, the UK, Germany, Japan, among others. In an article published in Foreign Affairs, Professor Daniel Drezner of Tufts University criticized successive U.S. administrations for abusing economic coercion and economic violence and using sanctions as the preferred solution to diplomatic problems, which have been ineffective and causing humanitarian disasters.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Since 1979, the United States has imposed various types of unilateral sanctions on Iran and other countries. In 1996, it rolled out the D'Amato Act which forbids foreign companies from investing in the energy sector of Iran and Libya, resulting in long-term damaging ramifications. Afterward, the United States keeps ramping up sanctions against Iran. Under the Trump administration, it harbored a policy of \"maximum pressure\" and wanted to use sanctions to effect a regime change in Iran. According to then Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, sanctions under the Trump administration caused at least US$200 billion worth of economic damage to Iran; he condemned such sanctions as inhumane, a crime and an act of terrorism.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Between 1980 and 1992, the United States imposed unilateral sanctions on Libya, and from 1992 to 2003, it rallied or coerced allies into expanding sanctions against Libya. The World Bank noted that Libya suffered up to US$18 billion economic losses as a result of the sanctions, while an official Libyan estimate put the figure at 33 billion.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Crude U.S. sanctions on Iraq after the Gulf War brought about serious consequences. From August 1990 to May 2003, they caused a total loss of US$150 billion in Iraq's oil revenue. As a result, the country's per capita income falls below its 1990 level of US$7,050 even to this day. The sanctions have also caused a serious humanitarian disaster, with infant mortality rate doubling and the under-five mortality increasing six-fold. Meanwhile, Iraq's education, health and social security systems were destroyed; its literacy rate fell from 89 percent in 1987 to 57 percent in 1997.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Undermining the purposes and functions of various international governance mechanisms. The United States has frequently imposed unilateral sanctions outside the UN framework. In 2021 alone, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Department of Commerce and other agencies imposed various sanctions on as many as over 2,000 entities. As a result, the sanctioning function of the Security Council is undercut, seriously affecting its normal function of maintaining international peace and security. When the International Criminal Court (ICC) attempted to investigate suspected war crimes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the United States, with itself not being a member of the Court, responded by launching sanctions against ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and senior official Phakiso Mochochoko, sparking unanimous outcry from the international community. Despite the ruling of the Dispute Settlement Body of WTO that its Section 301 procedures are a violation of international law, the United States continues to launch various unilateral Section 301 investigations on imports from China and other countries, and keeps all existing Section 301 tariffs unchanged. Such actions have directly sabotaged the tariff concessions achieved by many rounds of difficult negotiations of the multilateral trading system, blatantly trampled on the purposes and spirit of the multilateral trading system, and eroded the cornerstone of the system's operation.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Undermining the interests of companies of other countries. To maintain its economic and technological supremacy, the United States abuses its public power to interfere with normal international commercial exchanges and competition. Under the pretext of safeguarding national security and fighting against human rights violations, it has adopted a package of measures including the Entity List and economic sanctions to restrict foreign enterprises from obtaining raw materials, items and technologies vital to their survival and development, sometimes even used secondary sanctions to cut those companies' normal trade with enterprises from other countries in an effort to disrupt their supply chains root and branch.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086A case in point is the imprisonment of a senior manager from the French company Alstom. In 2013, in order to beat Alstom in their business competition, the United States applied the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to arrest and detain Fr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9ric Pierucci on charges of bribing foreign officials. He was further induced to sign a plea deal and provide more evidence and information against his company, leaving Alstom no choice but to accept General Electric's acquisition, vanishing ever since from the Fortune 500 list. The U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has become a tool for its public power to suppress competitors and meddle in normal international business activities, announcing the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 complete departure from its long-standing self-proclaimed champion of liberal market economy.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In recent years, the United States has frequently employed the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (2016) to impose unilateral sanctions on entities in various countries deemed to have engaged in \"serious human rights violations.\" However, while exercising such unilateral sanctions, the United States has often violated the basic human rights of the sanctioned subjects disregarding the fact that their human rights are also entitled to protection.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086When COVID-19 was raging in the world, the U.S. government did not relent in imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran, Syria and other countries, making it difficult for these countries to obtain the much-needed medical supplies to fight the virus. As a result of the sanctions, Iran has been cut off access to essential medicines and medical equipment, putting the health of millions of Iranians in jeopardy. To raise funds to fight the pandemic, the Iranian government applied to the IMF for a US$5 billion dollar exclusive loan, but the effort was blocked by the United States. Even worse, the United States prevented Iran from importing COVID vaccines by freezing its overseas funds and threatening vaccine suppliers. As the Brookings Institution estimated, during the height of the pandemic in Iran, U.S. sanctions further exacerbated the spread of the virus and could have caused up to 13,000 of deaths.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is not something new. In spite of adaptations over time in its contents and measures, the nature of the U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has not changed: it has been, since the very beginning, a hegemonic tool to maintain U.S. hegemony, suppress foreign competitors, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and even subvert the governments of other countries. Over the last few years, the United States has abused long-arm jurisdiction by continuing to lower the threshold and intensifying measures to an unprecedented degree against wider range of targets. It not only undermines the principle of sovereign equality, violates international law, and erodes the multilateral order with the UN at its core, but also creates and intensifies tensions and conflicts among major countries, and poses a threat to the international security system established after World War II. It also interferes with and distorts normal international commercial exchanges and trade order, disrupts the supply chain of global trade, damages the interests of enterprises and raises their operating costs. The United States should renounce its illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction measures, and truly take up its international responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n\n", "id": "33aea3619a2732c4b1901b8536bcedb8"}

Both sides should jointly deepen and substantiate the Cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries (China-CEEC Cooperation) to inject new impetus into cooperation. China advocates practicing true multilateralism, and believes that China and Slovenia should strengthen communication and coordination in multilateral fields and safeguard basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. There is no conflict of fundamental interests between China and the European Union (EU). When Europe remains prosperous, China stands to benefit, and the EU should form a right perception of China. Both sides should keep cooperation stable to respond to the uncertainties of the world situation, and jointly contribute to world peace and development. China hopes that Slovenia, as a member state of the EU, plays a constructive role in promoting steady and sound development of China-EU relations.\n\n\u00c5\u00bdbogar said that Slovenia admires China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extraordinary achievements, and appreciates China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important role in international affairs. The new Slovenian government attaches great importance to developing Slovenia-China relations, and will remain committed to the one-China principle, strengthening high-level exchanges and deepening bilateral cooperation in various fields, and will actively participate in various activities within the framework of China-CEEC Cooperation mechanism. Slovenia hopes to be supported by China and stands ready to participate in affairs of multilateral institutions more actively and enhance communication and cooperation with China in multilateral institutions. Slovenia is glad to see that the EU and China focus more on consensus and join hands in responding to global challenges, and is ready to play a positive role in it.\n\nThe two sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis and other regional and international hotspot issues.\n\n\n\n", "id": "363176644fc63e61bec3bdc2d71e2d74"}

Jashim Uddin. They exchanged views on bilateral relations and other issues.\n\nLiu Jinsong congratulated Uddin and welcomed him to China for assuming the new post. Noting that China and Bangladesh are close neighbors with traditional friendship, Liu Jinsong said that the bilateral relationship has withstood the test of changes in the international landscape and respective domestic situations, and kept developing steadily, setting a fine example of treating each other as equals and living in amity between countries of different sizes. He noted that in recent years, leaders of China and Bangladesh have maintained close exchanges through different modalities, with mutual understanding and mutual trust between the two countries increasingly deepening and high-quality Belt and Road cooperation yielding fruitful results. Recalling accompanying State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Bangladesh for a visit in August this year, Liu Jinsong said that during the visit he saw for himself Bangladesh's economic and social development, and keenly felt the strong public support for China-Bangladesh friendship in the country, and the interconnection and mutual reinforcement between the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation and the dream of Sonar Bangla (golden Bangla). Liu Jinsong pointed out that China has just introduced an overall plan to manage COVID-19 with measures against Class-B infectious diseases and refined the management of cross-border travel, which will greatly promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and Bangladesh.\n\nLiu Jinsong thanked the Ambassador for coming to the Foreign Ministry to mourn the passing of Comrade Jiang Zemin shortly after his assumption of office, noting that this has reflected his friendly sentiment towards the Chinese people. He stressed that the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) successfully held not long ago has laid out the essential goals of Chinese modernization, and underscored China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to enhancing friendly ties, mutual trust, and converging interests with neighboring countries in accordance with the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness and the policy of forging friendships and partnerships with its neighbors; the recently concluded Central Economic Work Conference has emphasized the importance of promoting high-standard opening up and redoubling efforts to boost domestic demand; and the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative put forward by President Xi Jinping have offered Chinese proposals for addressing common challenges of mankind and achieving enduring peace and security in the world. Liu said that all this will bring greater opportunities to China-Bangladesh cooperation, and China is ready to work with Bangladesh to quickly implement the important common understandings reached between the leaders of the two countries, deepen friendly exchanges and cooperation in various fields, help Bangladesh advance industrialization, modernization and digitalization, and jointly promote the building of a human community with a shared future.\n\nUddin expressed Bangladesh's congratulations on the success of the 20th CPC National Congress. He said that Bangladesh appreciates China's great achievements in economic development and pandemic response, and thanks China for its valuable support for the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fight against the pandemic in the past few years. Recalling President Xi Jinping's historic visit to Bangladesh in 2016, the Ambassador said that the visit has upgraded bilateral relations to a strategic cooperative partnership, and yielded a number of practical outcomes, opening a new chapter in Bangladesh-China relations. He also noted the successful visit by State Councilor Wang Yi to Bangladesh in August this year, saying that China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner, a sincere friend and an important development partner. He stressed that Bangladesh has always firmly upheld the one-China policy and always attached importance to and actively participated in the major initiatives put forward by China, and that Bangladesh looks forward to engaging in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with China, advancing the construction of major projects, and stepping up cultural, educational, youth and other people-to-people exchanges and cooperation between the two sides.

Recent days have seen frequent high-level interactions between the two countries. President Xi Jinping met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the sidelines of the Samarkand Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Their meeting steered the course for the development of China-Pakistan relations in the new era and injected strong impetus into the China-Pakistan all-weather friendship. State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe met with Chief of Army Staff Qamar Javed Bajwa of Pakistan in Xi'an. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on the sidelines of the General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly. China is ready to work with Pakistan to follow through on the important common understanding reached by the leaders of the two countries, promote the development of the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries, and accelerate the building of a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that Chinese leaders are very concerned about the floods and post-disaster reconstruction in Pakistan. The thoughts of the Chinese government and people are with our \u00e2\u0080\u009cironclad\u00e2\u0080\u009d friends in the disaster-hit areas of Pakistan. People of all sectors in China are making effort to support Pakistan's disaster relief endeavor, mounting a multi-dimensional and large-scale relief operation that involves the whole of government and society, and is quickly and effectively executed. This is another vivid example of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cironclad\u00e2\u0080\u009d friendship between China and Pakistan. China will continue to provide support to Pakistan and deepen cooperation with the country in pandemic response, disaster early warning and monitoring, and post-disaster reconstruction, among other things.\n\nLiu Jinsong noted that some countries have tried to deflect attention from mounting domestic problems by pointing fingers at the human rights situation of other countries. Their acts can be best described by the Urdu proverb that \"Thieves steal things and then go to Mecca for hajj.\" They also politicize, instrumentalize and weaponize human rights issues, and gang up on developing countries. Just as another Urdu proverb has put it, \"The yellow dog and the jackal are brothers.\" China stands ready to maintain close coordination and cooperation with Pakistan on multilateral platforms to jointly safeguard the common interests of developing countries and international fairness and justice.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that currently, many developing countries are facing energy shortages and debt plight, caused in part by geopolitical conflicts and the pandemic. But more importantly, we must not lose sight of the deep-rooted underlying problems, that is, certain countries are bent on imposing unilateral sanctions, disrupting the normal operation of the international coal, oil and natural gas markets; they also intervene in oil and gas prices out of political motives, disturbing market mechanisms; and some developed countries are snapping up energy resources, driving up commodity prices, with developing countries short of oil and gas bearing the brunt of the impact. In addition, the US Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike and balance sheet reduction have accelerated the capital outflow from emerging markets and increased the debt burden of developing countries. Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal recently called for measures to deal with the crises and to provide support to developing countries mired in difficulties. At the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) recently held in New York, all parties agreed to focus on the pressing challenges and jointly address outstanding issues such as food security, poverty reduction, energy security, and disruption of industrial and supply chains. China is ready to deepen cooperation with Pakistan to jointly safeguard food and energy security and financial stability, and push for an international economic order that is more just and equitable.\n\nHaque noted that he attended the disaster relief donation ceremony hosted by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries days ago, and was deeply touched to witness the generous donations of 125 million RMB yuan, in kind and cash, by representatives from various provinces and cities of China. He said that Pakistan will make optimum use of the aid funds and supplies, and expressed the hope that China will continue to support Pakistan in such areas as post-disaster recovery, infrastructure building, economic relief, agricultural restoration and energy supply. He underscored that Pakistan has always supported China in safeguarding its core interests, and delivered the joint statement at the UN Human Rights Council on behalf of nearly 70 countries, rejecting interference in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. Pakistan is ready to work with China to implement the GDI, jointly address challenges such as energy and food security, and achieve economic recovery and sustainable development.\n\n", "id": "385dff0e5dd83ee3b37f3022b4b14265"}

{"date": "2023-02-21", "title": "The Global Security Initiative\u00e2\u0080\u0082Concept Paper", "content": "I.Background\n\nThe issue of security bears on the well-being of people of all countries, the lofty cause of world peace and development, and the future of humanity.\n\nToday, our world, our times and history are changing in ways like never before, and the international community is confronted with multiple risks and challenges rarely seen before. Regional security hotspots keep flaring up, local conflicts and turbulence occur frequently, the COVID-19 pandemic persists, unilateralism and protectionism have risen significantly, and traditional and non-traditional security threats are entwined. The deficits in peace, development, security and governance are growing, and the world is once again at a crossroads in history.\n\nThis is an era rife with challenges. It is also one brimming with hope. We are convinced that the historical trends of peace, development and win-win cooperation are unstoppable. Upholding world peace and security and promoting global development and prosperity should be the common pursuit of all countries. Chinese President Xi Jinping has proposed the Global Security Initiative (GSI), calling on countries to adapt to the profoundly changing international landscape in the spirit of solidarity, and address the complex and intertwined security challenges with a win-win mindset. The GSI aims to eliminate the root causes of international conflicts, improve global security governance, encourage joint international efforts to bring more stability and certainty to a volatile and changing era, and promote durable peace and development in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nII.Core concepts and principles\n\n1. Stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. In 2014, President Xi Jinping initiated a new vision for common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, which has been widely recognized and supported by the international community. The essence of this new vision of security is to advocate a concept of common security, respecting and safeguarding the security of every country; a holistic approach, maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains and enhancing security governance in a coordinated way; a commitment to cooperation, bringing about security through political dialogue and peaceful negotiation; and pursuit of sustainable security, resolving conflicts through development and eliminating the breeding ground for insecurity. We believe security will only be firmly established and sustainable when it is underpinned by morality, justice and the right ideas.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\n2. Stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. Sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs are basic principles of international law and the most fundamental norms governing contemporary international relations. We believe all countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community. Their internal affairs brook no external interference, their sovereignty and dignity must be respected, and their right to independently choose social systems and development paths must be upheld. Sovereign independence and equality must be upheld, and efforts should be made for all countries to enjoy equality in terms of rights, rules and opportunities.\n\n3. Stay committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter embody the deep reflection by people around the world on the bitter lessons of the two world wars. They are humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s institutional design for collective security and lasting peace. The various confrontations and injustices in the world today did not occur because the purposes and principles of the UN Charter are outdated, but because they are not effectively maintained and implemented. We call on all countries to practice true multilateralism; firmly uphold the international system with the UN at its core, the international order underpinned by international law and the basic norms of international relations underpinned by the UN Charter; and uphold the authority of the UN and its status as the main platform for global security governance. The Cold War mentality, unilateralism, bloc confrontation and hegemonism contradict the spirit of the UN Charter and must be resisted and rejected.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\n4. Stay committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously. Humanity is an indivisible security community. Security of one country should not come at the expense of that of others. We believe all countries are equal in terms of security interests. The legitimate and reasonable security concerns of all countries should be taken seriously and addressed properly, not persistently ignored or systemically challenged. Any country, while pursuing its own security, should take into account the reasonable security concerns of others. We uphold the principle of indivisible security, advocating the indivisibility between individual security and common security, between traditional security and non-traditional security, between security rights and security obligations, and between security and development. There should be a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, so as to realize universal security and common security.\n\n5. Stay committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation. War and sanctions are no fundamental solution to disputes; only dialogue and consultation are effective in resolving differences. We call on countries to strengthen strategic communication, enhance mutual security confidence, diffuse tensions, manage differences and eliminate the root causes of crises. Major countries must uphold justice, fulfill their due responsibilities, support consultation on an equal footing, and facilitate talks for peace, play good offices and mediate in light of the needs and will of the countries concerned. The international community should support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises, and encourage conflicting parties to build trust, settle disputes and promote security through dialogue. Abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction does not solve a problem, but only creates more difficulties and complications.\n\n6. Stay committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world, both the intension and extension of security are broadening. Security is more interconnected, transnational and diverse. Traditional and non-traditional security threats have become intertwined. We encourage all countries to practice the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits in global governance, and work together to address regional disputes and global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity and biosecurity. There should be concerted efforts to explore multiple channels, develop a holistic solution, and improve relevant rules, so as to find sustainable solutions, promote global security governance and prevent and resolve security challenges.\n\nThese six commitments are interlinked and mutually reinforcing, and are an organic whole of dialectical unity. Among them, the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security provides conceptual guidance; respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries is the basic premise; abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter is a primary benchmark; taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously is an important principle, peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation is a must choice; and maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains is an inherent requirement.\n\nIII. Priorities of cooperation\n\nIt is our common aspiration to achieve lasting world peace, so that all countries can enjoy a peaceful and stable external environment and their people can live a happy life with their rights fully guaranteed. Like passengers aboard the same ship, countries need to work in solidarity to foster a community of shared security for mankind and build a world that is free from fear and enjoys universal security.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nTo realize these visions, China is ready to conduct bilateral and multilateral security cooperation with all countries and international and regional organizations under the framework of the Global Security Initiative, and actively promote coordination of security concepts and convergence of interests. China calls on all parties to carry out single or multiple cooperation in aspects including but not limited to the following ones, so as to pursue mutual learning and complementarity and to jointly promote world peace and tranquility:\n\n1.Actively participate in formulating a New Agenda for Peace and other proposals put forth in Our Common Agenda by the UN Secretary-General. Support UN efforts to enhance conflict prevention and fully harness the peace-building architecture to assist post-conflict states in peace-building. Further leverage the Secretary-General\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Peace and Security Sub-Fund of the China-UN Peace and Development Trust Fund and support a bigger UN role in global security affairs.\n\nSupport the UN in enhancing capacity for implementing its peacekeeping mandate, uphold the three principles of \u00e2\u0080\u009cconsent of the parties, impartiality, and non-use of force except in self-defense and defense of the mandate\u00e2\u0080\u009d for peacekeeping operations, prioritize political solutions, and take a holistic approach to address both symptoms and root causes. Provide peacekeeping operations with adequate resources. Support the provision of sufficient, predictable and sustainable financial assistance to the African Union (AU) for it to carry out autonomous peacekeeping operations.\n\n2.Promote coordination and sound interaction among major countries and build a major country relationship featuring peaceful coexistence, overall stability and balanced development. Major countries shoulder particularly important responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security. Call on major countries to lead by example in honoring equality, good faith, cooperation and the rule of law, and in complying with the UN Charter and international law. Adhere to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, stick to the bottom line of no conflict and no confrontation, seek common ground while reserving differences, and manage differences.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\n3.Firmly uphold the consensus that \u00e2\u0080\u009ca nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Comply with the joint statement on preventing nuclear war and avoiding arms races issued by leaders of the five nuclear-weapon states in January 2022.

A certain country selectively applies international law. On the one hand, it gangs up on countries who don't follow suit, forms an exclusive clique and makes rules that suit its bloc.

That certain country puts its domestic law above international treaties, abuses \"long-arm jurisdiction\" and unilateral sanctions, and uses force or threatens other countries by force at every turn. The certain country practices double standards and exceptionalism, violently interferes in other countries' internal affairs, and undermines other countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nXie Feng pointed out, Pelosi's sneaky visit to Taiwan is a serious violation of the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiqu\u00c3\u00a9s, a serious violation of the consensus of the international community on the one-China principle, a serious violation of the principle of international law of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity, a serious violation of non-interference in internal affairs, which is a basic norm governing international relations, a serious violation of the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration and the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, and a serious damage of the international order.

The establishment of the China-Caribbean Development Center is a vivid practice for both sides to join hands to implement the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Global Development Initiative, and is another milestone for China and Caribbean countries to create prosperity and development together, presenting a lavish gift to the co-celebration of the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Caribbean countries. China is willing to work with its Caribbean friends to build the China-Caribbean Development Center as a new platform for development and cooperation between the two sides and forge an even closer China-Caribbean community with a shared future.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "494833c4275532e681a3a0a1d0f9e200"}

Thai Deputy Prime Minister and a number of ministers greeted the first group of Chinese tourists to Thailand in three years at the airport with garlands and a welcome banner written in Chinese characters \"China and Thailand are one family. Amazing Thailand always warmly welcomes our Chinese family!\" Those Chinese tourists were very happy and same as people back in China who expressed the hope to visit their \u00e2\u0080\u009cThai relatives\" later.

{"date": "2022-09-23", "title": "Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng Attends the Third Ministerial Meeting of the \"Group of Friends in Defense of the Charter of the United Nations\"", "content": "\n\nOn September 22, 2022, Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng attended the third ministerial meeting of the \"Group of Friends in Defense of the Charter of the United Nations\" in New York as the representative of State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The meeting was chaired by Venezuelan Foreign Minister Carlos Faria and attended by foreign ministers or representatives of the Group members.\n\nXie Feng noted in his speech that with profound changes unseen in a century evolving at a faster pace, the world has entered a new phase of turbulence and transformation. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter have been challenged time and again, and unilateralism and bullying acts have been on the rise. It is important that we follow the historical trends, stay on the right course, and make sustained effort to fulfill our responsibility of upholding fairness and justice and promote peace and development.\n\nXie Feng put forward three propositions: First, stay true to the original aspiration and uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. The UN Charter is the cornerstone of the post-war international order. It lays out at the outset the purposes of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation, and specifies the principles of sovereign equality, peaceful settlement of international disputes and non-interference in others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 internal affairs, which constitute the basic norms governing international relations. They are the \"golden rules\" for maintaining world peace, the essential safeguards for the very survival of developing countries, and the right course to follow to realize the common progress of mankind. Today, hegemonism and power politics have seriously jeopardized the implementation of the purposes and principles of the Charter, and gravely undermined world peace and cooperation. We must categorically reject all acts of hegemonism, power politics and bullying, push for an international order that is more just and more equitable, promote greater democracy in international relations, and safeguard the effectiveness and dignity of the Charter.\n\nSecond, stand our ground and make all-out efforts to prevent surfacing of a \"new Cold War\". It was not easy for mankind to get out of the shadow of the Cold War more than 30 years ago. Yet, some countries today want to reverse the course by attempting to drag the world back into the abyss of the Cold War. A handful of countries, obsessed with their position of strength, have stubbornly pursued policies that put their own interests first, distort and misinterpret the purposes and principles of the Charter at will, and selectively apply internationally recognized rules as they fit their needs. Be it division and confrontation between military blocs, or the law of the jungle, it is always the developing countries that suffer the most. We should stay united and speak in one loud voice against this historical countercurrent, and reject the acts of inciting ideological confrontation, coercing other countries into taking sides, concocting false narratives of \"democracy vs. autocracy\", and politicizing and weaponizing economic and technological issues. We should jointly say \"no\" to a \"new Cold War\", draw lessons from the past, and move towards the future.\n\nThird, uphold solidarity and support each other's core concerns. Some Group members have been suffering from the suppression, containment and blockade by the hegemonic forces, with a heavy toll on their economic development and social welfare. Such a situation should not be allowed to continue. We should coordinate closely, and firmly support each other on issues concerning respective core interests, and speak up for each other on multilateral occasions such as the United Nations. It is important to jointly oppose acts of inciting \"color revolution\" and interfering in other countries' internal affairs. All countries' rights to choose their own social systems and development paths should be safeguarded, and their future should be firmly held in their own hands. We should champion peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are common values of humanity. China encourages more countries to join our ranks to pool strength for fairness and justice, and strengthen the big family in defense of the UN Charter.\n\nXie Feng stressed that Taiwan is a sacred and inalienable part of China's territory, and the one-China principle has become a universally recognized basic norm governing international relations. The UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 adopted in 1971 has solved once and for all the issue of representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the United Nations in political, legal and procedural terms. Over the past five decades, the United Nations has always referred to Taiwan as \"Taiwan, Province of China\": this is Taiwan's only status in international law. Any question concerning Taiwan's participation in the activities of international organizations must be resolved under the one-China principle. At present, certain countries attempt to turn back the wheel of history and deliberately distort the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. Such acts blatantly challenge the one-China principle and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter such as respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, and non-interference in others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 internal affairs. They must be resolutely opposed and stopped.\n\nXie Feng said that China was the first country to sign the UN Charter. Its efforts to defend the purposes and principles of the Charter have never slackened, and its struggles for realizing the beautiful vision depicted in the Charter have never stopped. No matter how the international situation may change, China will always be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order. Having put forward the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, China stands ready to work with other countries to achieve common security and promote sustainable development. China will work with the Group members to unite more closely under the UN banner and make new and sustained contributions to the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nParticipants in the meeting stressed that safeguarding the UN Charter is crucial to building a fair and equal international order. The Group members should step up communication and coordination to jointly resist unilateralism and the Cold War mentality, and safeguard multilateralism with the UN at its core. At the end of the meeting, a Political Declaration was issued which stressed the need to abide by the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and to reject the practice of using human rights and democracy as a tool to attack sovereign states. It also called for the early lifting of unilateral coercive measures.\n\nInitiated by Venezuela, the \"Group of Friends in Defense of the Charter of the United Nations\" was established in July 2021. Its current members include China, Russia, Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Iran, Syria, Palestine, Cambodia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Cuba, and Nicaragua.\n\n", "id": "4b8c36574358370481e5abaf0cf844c5"}

China is ready to work with Myanmar to implement the outcomes of President Xi Jinping's historic visit to Myanmar in 2020 and deepen the high-quality cooperation on jointly building the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, so as to inject new impetus into the building of a China-Myanmar community with a shared future and better benefit the two peoples.\n\nLiu Jinsong briefed on the guiding principles of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Central Economic Work Conference, stressing that this year marks the beginning of China's full implementation of the guiding principles laid down at the 20th CPC National Congress.

The two sides had a friendly and in-depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and international and regional issues of common concern.\n\nLiu Jinsong said, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that China and Vietnam constitute a strategic community with a shared future. Currently, bilateral relations continue to maintain the sound momentum of development. China is ready to make joint efforts with Vietnam to well plan bilateral and multilateral exchanges and cooperation in the next stage, and further consolidate friendship and deepen mutual trust, so as to elevate the China-Vietnam comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership to new heights.\n\nLiu Jinsong said, recently, the issues related to food, energy, industrial and supply chains, and financial security have become increasingly prominent across the globe. All of them are closely related to the internal and external policy adjustment of a major Western country. In particular, by rapidly increasing interest rates, it has caused global financial turmoil; by abusing tariff means and unilateral sanctions, it has aggravated hyperinflation at home and abroad; by creating small circles here and there and peddling \"friend-shoring\", it has undermined the normal operation of the global industrial and supply chains. Such moves have brought deep suffering to Asian countries. Lawrence Summers, a senior U.S. economist and former Treasury Secretary, recently pointed out, \"I like to compare the Fed's problem to the challenge of adjusting the shower in an old hotel, where there's a lag of 20 or 30 seconds between the time you turn the faucet and the time the water temperature changes. It's very difficult to avoid either scalding yourself or freezing yourself. You turn, and nothing much happens, and so you turn more, and then, all of a sudden, you're jumping out of the shower.\" His description is quite vivid. The U.S. dollar is the currency of the United States, but it has increasingly become a problem for all countries in the world. This strange phenomenon is worth pondering.\n\nLiu Jinsong said, recently, senior U.S. officials openly declared that the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) marks an important turning point in restoring U.S. economic leadership in the region and presenting Indo-Pacific countries \"an alternative to China's approach\". That fully demonstrates that IPEF is designed to serve, firstly, the U.S. economic hegemony, then the U.S. strategy towards China. The United States coerces regional countries to take sides by economic means. China firmly opposes such moves, and regional countries are also disinterested in them. IPEF, which is neither inclusive nor equal, is in essence \"four-pronged unilateralism\", that is, unilaterally pushing ahead with U.S. global and regional geopolitical strategy; unilaterally peddling U.S. standards and systems; unilaterally requiring regional countries to open their markets; and unilaterally decide on the list of the countries joining IPEF, as well as the areas and pace of cooperation. Such acts go against economic laws and free trade principles, run counter to the trend of economic globalization, and undermine and challenge ASEAN's centrality in regional cooperation. As a Vietnamese proverb goes, \"An elephant's head and a rat's tail \u00e2\u0080\u0093 much work for a little result\", such acts will eventually come to naught. President Xi Jinping has pointed out that anyone who attempts to turn back the wheel of history and block others' way will only have his own path blocked.\n\nPham Sao Mai spoke highly of the sound development momentum of the relations between the two parties and between the two countries, and said that Vietnam is ready to work with China to strengthen the strategic guidance of high-level exchanges, promote pragmatic cooperation, jointly follow through on the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two parties and the two countries, and promote new and greater development of bilateral relations. Vietnam will not participate in exclusive circles targeting third parties, and will treat relevant international economic initiatives on the basis of an independent foreign policy.\n\nLiu Jinsong presented Pham Sao Mai with President Xi Jinping's keynote speech at the Opening Ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum, the Global Development Report, remarks by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the Launch of the Global Development Report, and Reality Check: Falsehoods in US Perceptions of China.\n\n", "id": "514f7fcc8f2d355ca8cd2d015d4d1059"}

He briefed the press on China's diplomacy in the new era and answered questions from Chinese and foreign media.\n\nMa Zhaoxu said that since the 18th CPC National Congress, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, China's foreign service has forged ahead against all odds on the historical journey of advancing the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Having pull through all the risks and tests and overcome difficulties and obstacles, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diplomacy has accomplished many great tasks, and made pioneering and historical achievements in all respects, blazing a new path of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and creating a sound external environment for realizing the two centenary goals and the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.\n\nMa Zhaoxu stressed that with a firm grasp of the development trends in China and the world, and profound thinking about the future of mankind, General Secretary Xi Jinping has inherited and carried forward the core principles and fine traditions of the New China's diplomacy, made major innovations in diplomatic theory and practice, and put forth a series of new ideas, new propositions and new initiatives that carry distinctive Chinese characteristics, embody the spirit of the times and spearhead the trend of human progress and development, thus forming Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. Leading by example, General Secretary Xi Jinping has carried out a series of splendid and fruitful head-of-state diplomacy that has deepened the international community's understanding of China, demonstrated his amiable leadership charisma of treating others with sincerity and valuing goodwill and friendship, and testified to the irreplaceable important role and strategic value of head-of-state diplomacy. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, we have devoted ourselves to the main task of serving national rejuvenation and promoting human progress, and ground our efforts on the new goals of China's development. By grasping the new changes in China's relations with the world, and acting on the philosophy of helping others to succeed while seeking our own success and taking a global perspective, we have steadfastly pursued the path of peaceful development, and worked for building a community with a shared future for mankind, and a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation. We will always be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order.\n\nMa Zhaoxu pointed out that building a community with a shared future for mankind is the overall goal of China's diplomacy in the new era. China upholds the vision of a global community of development with a shared future, and is committed to advancing the Belt and Road cooperation in line with the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. Standing at the forefront of international anti-pandemic cooperation, China has carried out the largest global emergency humanitarian operation since the founding of the New China, and promoted the building of a global community of health for all. Since last year, General Secretary Xi Jinping has successively put forward the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, further enriching the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind. China's call for building a community with a shared future for mankind has been echoed by more and more countries.\n\nWe in the Chinese diplomatic service have conducted China's diplomacy in a comprehensive, multi-level and multi-faceted way, engaging in dialogue, exchanges and cooperation with other countries in the world. The total number of countries with which China has established diplomatic relations has increased to 181, and we have established partnerships with more than 110 countries and regional organizations, making friends across the world and putting in place a global partnership network. We have worked actively to promote reform and development of the global governance system, safeguard and support the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law, practice true multilateralism, and uphold peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are common values of humanity. We have taken concrete actions to support global pandemic response, address climate change, and promote sustainable development, and put forward China's proposals on addressing global governance deficit and global challenges, making our share of contributions.\n\nWe have built a strong line of defense to safeguard state interests and national dignity with a firmer will, more solid actions and stronger measures. We have taken clear-cut stance and never backed down on major issues of principle. We face challenges head-on and fight resolutely on the Taiwan question and issues related to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Xizang, maritime affairs and human rights, among others. By so doing, we have effectively safeguarded national sovereignty, security and development interests, and held the initiative in national development and security firmly in our own hands. We have engaged in diplomatic struggle that is aimed at fighting words and deeds that harm China's national interests and national dignity, safeguarding legitimate rights and interests, opposing hegemonism and bullying, and upholding international fairness and justice.\n\nWe act on the philosophy of putting the people front and center, focus on the central work of the Party and the country, serve China's economic and social development, and firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese expats and legal persons overseas. We have more than 280 embassies and consular offices around the world that provide consular services to Chinese nationals overseas. With the assistance of the foreign ministry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consular service emergency hotline 12308 that runs 24/7, consular protection is made available to Chinese citizens wherever they go. The motherland is always the strong backing the Chinese people can rely on.\n\nMa Zhaoxu noted that looking ahead, the successful convocation of 20th CPC National Congress will surely chart the course for China's diplomatic work to break new grounds and make greater strides in the new era. The diplomatic service will rally closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and profoundly appreciate the decisive significance of the establishment of both Comrade Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole and the guiding role of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. We will further strengthen our consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment with the central Party leadership. We will stay confident in the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We will uphold Comrade Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole, and uphold the Central Committee's authority and its centralized, unified leadership. We will strive to write a new chapter of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in the new era.\n\n\n\n", "id": "53f64e23db9b3b3daee781cfb9cb206c"}

Ever since colonial times, immigrants from around the world have come to the country in waves. However, the history of U.S. treatment of immigrants is one rife with inhumane tragedies such as discrimination, exclusion, arrest, detention, expulsion, and a litany of human rights abuses. Worse still, the recent years have witnessed one humanitarian disaster after another caused by the U.S. government on refugees and immigrants going to the country.\n\nThis report gives a truthful account of the United States' egregious record on the issue of refugees and immigrants by reviewing events in the past and present within the United States and beyond. Using facts and figures, this report lays bare the lies and double standards on the issue of refugees and immigrants of the United States, a self-proclaimed \"beacon of democracy.\"\n\nI.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Violations of the Rights of Immigrants in the United States\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 When the United States was first founded, white Americans, mainly Anglo-Saxon Protestants, were very suspicious of immigrants and tried to restrict and assimilate them. A U.S. president once said outright that there is no need to encourage emigration \"except of useful mechanic's-and some particular descriptions of men-or professions.\" Fearful of domestic chaos inspired by the French Revolution, in 1798, the U.S. government formulated the laws such as the Naturalization Act, the Alien Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act. These acts made it more difficult for immigrants to become U.S. citizens and gave the president the power to imprison and deport dangerous immigrants or those from enemy countries. It is worth noting that the Alien Enemies Act is still in effect today.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Black people are among the earliest immigrants to the United States. Their immigration was not voluntary, but forced. After they arrived in the United States, they suffered inhuman abuses and had no human rights to speak of. In 1619, the first 20 Africans were sold as slaves to the colony of Virginia. Soon after that, the colonies passed laws to legitimate black slaves as \"permanent property\" whose children also automatically became slaves. The idea and the system of racism against blacks have thus taken root in America. In order to justify the enslavement of blacks, white people established an oppressive racial hierarchy based on skin color. The United States Declaration of Independence declared that \"all men are created equal.\" Nonetheless, the earliest U.S. Constitution did not recognize the civil rights of blacks. The three-fifths clause was introduced, under which the actual number of black slaves would be multiplied by three-fifths in the allocation of House seats. The harms of historical enslavement still haunt black descendants today. Their rights to life, development and political participation are not effectively secured.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Irish immigrants were severely discriminated against and alienated in the early years of the United States. Between the 1830s and the 1860s, Catholic Irish immigrated to the United States in large numbers. A strong movement against Irish immigrants emerged. Irish immigrants were stigmatized and labeled as being lazy, inferior, violent and dangerous. A large number of early American nativist and exclusionist organizations and political parties were formed at this time. The American Party, or the Know-Nothing Party, made anti-Irish immigration its main agenda. In the 1850s, the party produced seven governors, eight senators and 104 House representatives. New York and Massachusetts enacted laws to deport and repatriate Irish immigrants. Xenophobes even resorted to violence, attacking Irish immigrants and burning down their churches. In 1844, riots against Irish immigrants broke out in Philadelphia, causing at least 20 deaths. Irish immigrants were treated as blacks and were not accepted by white Americans until the 20th century. They were long-time victims of racial discrimination in the United States.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The anti-Chinese movement is among the most infamous in discriminating and ostracizing immigrants in the U.S. history. Since the mid-19th century, Chinese laborers were trafficked in large numbers by Americans to the United States as coolies. By 1880, the total number had exceeded 100,000. The Chinese laborers undertook the most arduous work in the construction of the Central Pacific Transcontinental Railroad. Thousands of people died. They made enormous contributions to the development of the United States with their hard work and even their lives, but were not treated with respect and kindness which they deserved because of rampant racism in the United States. As the railroad projects came to completion, the United States began to turn its back on those who helped it. In 1875, the U.S. Congress passed the Page Act, obstructing the entry of Chinese laborers and women. In 1882, the United States went further and enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, putting an absolute end to immigration from China and denying resident Chinese immigrants U.S. citizenship. It was the first and only law in the United States to ban all members of a specific ethnic group from immigrating to the country on the grounds of race and nationality. It was not until 1943 that it was formally repealed. To prevent Chinese immigration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services established an immigration detention facility on San Francisco's Angel Island in 1910, which remained open until 1940. Meanwhile, Chinese immigrants suffered from severe violent attacks. On Oct. 24, 1871, 19 Chinese immigrants were killed by hundreds of white people around Calle de los Negros in Los Angeles. In 1877, the houses of Chinese residents in Calle de los Negros were burned down by white people. In 1876 and 1877, two riots erupted in which armed white racists attacked Chinatown in San Francisco. Then on Sept.2, 1885, white miners rioted on the Stone Springs mine in Wyoming, destroying the residential village of Chinese workers and killing at least 28 Chinese immigrants.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Japanese immigrants were discriminated against and ostracized in the United States. Although Japan had undergone Meiji Restoration and championed \"leaving Asia and entering Europe\" at the turn of the 20th century, Japanese immigrants still faced discrimination and exclusion in the United States because of their different skin color and distinctive culture. The U.S. West Coast saw a particularly strong anti-Japanese sentiment. San Francisco adopted a policy to ban Japanese schoolchildren from public schools. In 1907, the United States and Japan reached the so-called Gentlemen's Agreement, meaning the United States would limit the entry of Japanese immigrants, and Japan would voluntarily ban immigration to the United States. In 1913, the California state government enacted the Alien Land Law, barring Asian immigrants, including Japanese, from owning land. In 1917, the U.S. Congress enacted the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which barred most Asians from immigrating to the United States. After the adoption of the Immigration Act of 1924, the Japanese were completely banned from immigrating to the United States. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were forcibly moved by the U.S. government from the West Coast to internment camps further inland. They had to take \"loyalty questionnaires\" to completely remove their suspicion of being an enemy alien. It was not until 1988 that the U.S. government formally apologized.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086White immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe were strongly ostracized in the United States. Immigrants from countries like Italy, Poland, Greece and Russia made up the majority of U.S. immigrants at the turn of the 20th century. In 1911, the U.S. Congress released the Dillingham Commission report, claiming that Eastern and Southern European immigrants had made limited contributions to the United States and degraded the unique American race, culture and system. To curb their immigration, the report recommended having immigrants take literacy tests and introduced a nationality-based quota scheme. Racists sought to use the theory of evolution for their argument that immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe belonged to an inferior non-white race, and would contaminate the race of Anglo-Saxon whites in the United States. Xenophobes launched the Americanization Movement to deprive Eastern and Southern European immigrants of their language and culture, forcing them to be fully Americanized. Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Company, required migrant workers in his company to attend the so-called English Melting Pot School. White supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan recruited millions of members to terrorize and attack Eastern and Southern European immigrants across the country. The 1917 October Revolution in Russia triggered the first Red Scare in the United States. The U.S. government was convinced that communists were among Eastern and Southern European immigrants, and used this excuse to arrest and deport them in large numbers.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The fear of foreign immigrants eventually led to the adoption of a race-based quota system. Following the Chinese Exclusion Act, the U.S. government enacted a series of laws to restrict immigration, which culminated in the Immigration Act that the U.S. Congress passed in 1924. This Act stipulated that the annual number of immigrants from each country to the United States shall not exceed 2 percent of the number of foreign-born population of that nationality as recorded in the 1890 census. Since Americans was mainly made up of immigrants from Western and Northern Europe before 1890, the Act effectively banned Asian immigration and restricted immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe. Quotas for immigration from different countries were actually allocated based on skin color, race and religious beliefs. The primary goal was to ensure that the majority of Americans were Anglo-Saxon Protestants. It was not until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was passed that the restrictions based on ethnic origins were formally abolished, and that immigrants from different countries were granted a relatively equal right of entry.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Hispanic immigrants, especially Mexican immigrants, have been among the most rejected by the United States since the 1920s. Most of the immigrants arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol since its establishment in 1924 have been Mexicans. In 1929, the United States made illegal entry a felony in an attempt to stop Mexican immigration. During the Great Depression, tens of thousands of Mexicans were deported from the United States. After the passing of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, Mexico became the largest source of immigration to the country, with arrests and deportations of Mexican immigrants often accounting for 90 percent of the total. In the late 1970s, the number of Mexican immigrants arrested each year was close to 800,000, and then rose to 1.5 million by the late 1990s. The influx of Mexican immigrants once again stoked strong xenophobia within the United States. American political scientist Samuel Huntington points out in his book Who Are We that Mexican and Hispanic immigration \"could eventually change America into a country of two languages, two cultures, and two peoples.\" Hispanic immigrants are often a target of white supremacists in the United States. In 2019, angry at the ongoing \"Hispanic invasion\" in Texas, a white supremacist man drove more than a thousand kilometers to El Paso in West Texas and shot 23 people dead at a Walmart store. It was the largest domestic terrorist attack against Latinos in modern American history.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086After the 9/11 incident, Muslim immigrants became a key target of U.S. surveillance and exclusion. Shortly after 9/11, more than 1,200 people, mostly Arabs and Muslims, were arrested and detained by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. Many were held for months without charges and denied access to lawyers and family. Most ended up deported for minor immigration violations. More than 80,000 adult males from 25 Muslim countries were required by the U.S. government to be fingerprinted and photographed, among whom 13,000 migrants went into deportation proceedings and 2,870 were detained. The USA Patriot Act, enacted after 9/11, greatly expanded government powers, allowing the U.S. government to arbitrarily surveil and deport foreign nationals suspected of being involved in terrorism, and Muslims have become the main target group. The 9/11 incident had a strong impact on American society and allowed Islamophobia to penetrate deep into American politics. In 2017, the U.S. government enacted a Muslim ban, requiring that citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen be barred from entering the U.S. for at least 90 days.\n\nII. The Human Rights Violations Against Refugees and Immigrants in the United States See No Improvement\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In the 21st century, successive U.S. administrations have increasingly restricted immigration and treated immigrants harshly and inhumanely, with arrests, detentions, deportations and repatriation of immigrants on a large scale every year. The U.S. government arrested 850,000 migrants in 2019 and more than 1.7 million in 2021, a record high since 1986. The number of immigrants detained has grown rapidly. In August 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detained more than 203,000 illegal immigrants from Mexico. In fiscal year 2022, more than 2.3 million refugees and immigrants were arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border. A record high of more than 430,000 immigrants were deported from the United States in 2013. The number still reached 360,000 in 2019. More than 100,000 have been repatriated each year. In large-scale arrests, detentions, deportations and repatriation, the human rights of immigrants are grossly violated, and humanitarian disasters occur frequently. In September 2021, more than 15,000 refugees from Haiti gathered in the Texas border town of Del Rio, waiting for a slim chance to enter the United States. The refugees were brutalized by U.S. border enforcement agencies, with patrols on horseback wielding horse whips, charging into the crowd, and driving them into the river. The CNN commented that the scene was reminiscent of the dark periods in American history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves. On 25 October 2021, the United Nations Human Rights Council condemned the systematic and large-scale deportations by the United States of Haitian refugees and immigrants without assessing their individual situations as a violation of international law.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The migrant truck tragedy shows how rampant human smuggling and trafficking is in the United States. On 27 June 2022, a tractor-trailer packed with illegal immigrants was found on the outskirts of San Antonio, Texas. The truck came from Laredo, a border city in Texas 150 miles away from where the vehicle was found. Local human smugglers planned to transport illegal immigrants by truck via San Antonio to the U.S. hinterland. The truck, which was abandoned on the roadside due to mechanical failure, was found with no water or air conditioning in its compartment and nearly 100 people crammed in. Among them, 53 people died from the stifling heat as local temperatures peaked at 38 degrees Celsius. It was the nation's most serious migrant death case to date. Human trafficking and forced labor have been widespread in the United States due to long-standing ineffective law enforcement and lack of justice. Recent years have seen thousands of human smuggling and trafficking cases taking place annually and the frequent occurrences of similar migrant truck tragedies. In fiscal year 2021 alone, 557 illegal immigrants died along the southern border of the United States.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 After COVID-19 broke out, the U.S. government used COVID as an excuse for large-scale deportations of illegal immigrants. In 2020, the U.S. government invoked Title 42 of the United States Code to prohibit immigrants from entering under the pretext of stemming the spread of COVID. Scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the practice lacks a public health rationale and could instead increase the likelihood of the epidemic spreading. Through this practice, the U.S. government has made over 1.8 million deportations, expelling at least 215,000 parents and children, of whom 16,000 are unaccompanied children. The immigrants who were not deported for the time being were sent to detention facilities and continued to be subjected to inhumane treatment.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The United States has set up the world's largest immigration detention system. Currently, there are more than 200 detention facilities in its border states. In order to save costs, the U.S. government often hands construction and operation of the immigration detention camps over to private companies, making them de facto private prisons. The abysmal conditions in the camps make those detained highly susceptible to physical and psychological illness or death. In July 2019, after visiting border patrol stations on the U.S.-Mexico border, U.S. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she had witnessed that the women being detained were held without drinking water and that detention officers told them to drink out of the toilet. She said that border patrol stations treat migrants like animals, constituting systemic abuse. A total of 21 people died in U.S. immigration detention facilities in fiscal year 2020, CNN reported, more than doubling the death toll in fiscal year 2019 and the highest number since 2005. Up to 80 percent of the more than 1.7 million immigrants detained in the United States in fiscal year 2021 were held in private detention facilities, including 45,000 children. The El Paso Times reported on 25 June 2021 that private contractors had exacerbated the horrible chaos at the U.S. Fort Bliss shelter where nearly 5,000 children were held. In the shelter, about 1,500 children were jailed in a stockyard-like, jam-packed and terrible environment that resulted in severe physical and mental trauma.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The U.S. immigration policy has caused a serious humanitarian disaster to immigrants. To stop illegal immigrants from entering the country, the U.S. government has implemented a \"zero tolerance\" policy since April 2018, forcibly separating illegal immigrants from their minor children and detaining them in deplorable conditions. Footage provided by U.S. CBP shows some children even being held in cages with only thin blankets on their bodies. On 18 June 2018, at a meeting of the Human Rights Council, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, called the practice of forcing parents to part with their children as \"government-sanctioned child abuse.\" UN human rights officials also called on the United States, the only country in the world that had not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to join the Convention as soon as possible and to respect the rights of all children. Hundreds of thousands of people across the 50 states of the United States staged demonstrations with the theme \"Families Belong Together\" to protest against the \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy that has resulted in the separation of at least 2,300 children from their families.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The U.S. law enforcement agencies have never stopped abusing migrant children. In 2019, over a thousand children were still separated from their parents, and 20 percent of them were under the age of five. After COVID-19 struck, the U.S. government enforced the provisions in Title 42 of the U.S. Code, which exacerbated the humanitarian disaster arising from the separation of children and their parents. According to a CNN report on 23 April 2021, more than 5,000 unaccompanied children were in U.S. CBP custody, and many were kept for longer than the legal limit. Records show that among the 266,000 migrant children held in government custody in recent years, more than 25,000 have been detained for longer than 100 days, nearly 1,000 for more than a year and at least three for over five years. On 26 June 2019, The New York Times covered a visit by an inspection group consisting of lawyers, doctors and journalists to a detention center of a border station in Clint, Texas. They found that children there were held in prison-like conditions. Hundreds of children were locked in one cell with virtually no adult supervision. A member of the inspection group likened the conditions to \"torture facilities\". UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet was deeply shocked by the overcrowded U.S. detention facilities, the poor sanitation conditions and the lack of access to adequate healthcare or food, according to a UN website report on 8 July 2019. She stated that detaining migrant children may constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment that is prohibited under international law. According to a report on the website of The Guardian on 11 October 2021, between 2016 and 2021, U.S. border agents engaged in more than 160 cases of abuse of asylum seekers, including children. Leading law enforcement agencies, notably CBP and U.S. Border Patrol, were involved.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Even if illegal immigrants manage to escape from detention and deportation, it is difficult for them to be treated equally in American society and they tend to become victims of crimes. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that illegal immigrants enjoy the right to equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In reality, however, illegal immigrants often suffer from legal and institutional discrimination and hardly enjoy basic rights and benefits. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 abolished most forms of public relief for illegal immigrants and even banned their children born in the United States from being automatically granted citizenship and access to public benefits. Many illegal immigrants have fallen victim to human trafficking and forced labor in the United States. The Associated Press revealed on 10 December 2021 that for years, illegal immigrants smuggled into the United States ended up forced to toil on farms, cowing to threats of deportation and violence by overseers while they lived in dirty, cramped trailers with little food or clean water. Identification documents of the laborers were withheld, preventing them from leaving and seeking help. The U.S. Department of Justice website released an indictment on a human trafficking case on 22 November 2021. The document showed that dozens of workers were illegally imported from Mexico and Central America to farms in the State of Georgia. Trapped in illegal detention and forced labor in brutal conditions, the workers became victims of modern-day slavery. Promised high wages to work on farms, they were instead forced to dig onions with their bare hands, and got paid only 20 cents per filled bucket as men with guns kept them in check. At least two of them died, and another was raped repeatedly.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Today, the serious discrimination in American society against immigrants and their descendants remains. \"Asia Hate\" has been particularly prominent in recent years. According to a 2022 survey by Stop AAPI Hate, the organization had reported 11,467 hate incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) over the past two years. Only 49 percent of AAPIs felt safe going out and 65 percent worried about the safety of family members and elders. As many as 72 percent of AAPIs who experienced hate incidents named discrimination against them as their greatest source of stress, even ahead of their health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIII.Multiple Domestic Factors Behind the Entrenched Immigration and Refugee Problem in the United States\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Deep-rooted racial discrimination in the United States is an important cause of its immigration problem. Racism is embedded in U.S. immigration policies and its attitude toward immigrants. A country founded with Anglo-Saxon Protestants as the mainstay, the United States continues to view the culture of this population group as the core of its national identity. Immigrants who are not Anglo-Saxon Protestants are often regarded as the inferior race. With the influx of Hispanic and Asian immigrants, the United States is increasingly diverse in ethnicity and culture. In recent years, immigrants accounted for 40 percent of U.S. population increase. With the white population seriously ageing, immigrants are expected to contribute even more to U.S. population growth. The demographic change has left many white people worried about their own status. Hence, they are giving stronger support to conservative political stances, regardless of their party affiliation. A poll indicated that 56 percent of American voters believed the United States remained a racist society, and 70 percent of black respondents believed that more than half of white Americans believe in white supremacy.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Political polarization in the United States is worsening its immigration problem. In recent decades, the immigration issue has become more entangled with economic, racial and ideological issues as well as cultural values. The Democratic Party and the Republican Party have kept attacking each other, and a compromise is hard to reach. Democrats accuse Republicans of embracing nativism and white supremacy and inciting xenophobia and racial discrimination to win votes from the white population. Republicans accuse Democrats of accepting immigrants to gain more votes from ethnic minorities and more seats in the Congress. The partisan divide has prevented any significant immigration reform bill from passing Congress since the comprehensive Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Both Democrats and Republicans had put forth their own immigration reform proposals, but they all hit a dead end very soon.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Since the midterm election cycle began in 2022, both parties have used the refugee and immigrant issue as a political leverage. The administration pandered to voters and relaxed immigration control to some extent. With the \"American Dream\" rekindled, illegal immigrants flooded in across the borders. Some Republican governors transported refugees and illegal immigrants with buses and chartered planes from theirs to blue states and cities in an attempt to embarrass the federal government. In September 2022, Florida's Republican Governor flew 50 refugees from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Republican Governor of Texas bused over 100 Latin American refugees and immigrants right to the Vice President's doorstep. These immigrants were promised well-paid jobs before being transferred, only to find that still no proper settlement is available at their destination.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Conservative politicians and media in the United States are hyping up the immigrant threat and stoking anti-immigration sentiment. The far-right forces and conservative media have been disseminating a so-called \"great replacement\" theory, claiming that white Americans are being deliberately replaced by immigrants and ethnic minorities. This extreme idea has led to multiple terrorist attacks targeting immigrants and ethnic minorities in the country, the worst of which is the shooting incident in a shopping mall in El Paso. Since 2018, white supremacists have committed the most killings among violent extremist groups in the United States. In recent years, the Republicans have been playing up the immigrant threat in election campaigns, and drawn the attention from the conservatives to the immigration issue. They have rolled out many extreme anti-immigration measures, grossly violating the human rights of immigrants. For its part, the Democratic administration dare not to relax expulsion or detention of immigrants in fear of conservative opposition and in order to gain support from white voters, resulting in massive humanitarian disasters continuing in the United States. U.S. conservative politicians and media have also been depicting immigrants as grabbing jobs from low-skilled American workers, lowering wages, squeezing welfare resources, and increasing local government expenditure on education, healthcare and relief. They scapegoat immigrants for U.S. domestic problems, yet ignore their long-term, generally positive effect on the U.S. economy, such as supplying a large workforce, filling up low-level jobs that Americans won't take, and mitigating the impact of population ageing.\n\nIV.\u00e2\u0080\u0082The United States Is the Primary Cause of the Global Refugee Crisis\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The United States follows hegemonic and militaristic policies. Throughout the country's more than 240 years of history, only 16 years were without wars. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter candidly referred to the United States as \"the most warlike nation in the history of the world.\" The country's aggressive behaviors have led to waves of refugees. Since 2001, U.S. invasions have resulted in over 800,000 deaths and 20 million refugees in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other affected countries. According to a Brown University project entitled \"the Costs of War,\" military operations launched by the United States in 85 countries in the name of \"fighting terrorism\" since 2001 have costed 6.4 trillion U.S. dollars and claimed more than 929,000 lives. Up to 38 million people were displaced in the fightings.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In Asia, U.S. involvement in the Korean War resulted in over three million civilian deaths and around three million refugees. The trauma of war persists to this day. Many Korean families were divided because of the long-standing confrontation on the Peninsula. Official data from the ROK alone indicate that the number of people registered as divided family members exceeds 132,000. Many senior citizens worry that to reunite with their families in the DPRK would be too distant a dream in their lifetime. In the 1970s, after losing the Vietnam War, the United States withdrew hastily from Saigon, displacing innumerable refugees out of the country.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In the Middle East, the United States launched the Iraq War based on fabricated evidence in 2003, in the absence of authorization of the UN Security Council and despite strong opposition from the international community. According to Statista, a global database, around 209,000 Iraqi civilians died in the war and ensuing violent conflicts between 2003 and 2021, and around 9.2 million Iraqis became refugees or were forced to leave their homeland. The United States involved itself deeply in the Syrian war and the internal conflict in Libya through multiple proxies, causing prolonged conflicts and leaving political settlement and social stability elusive. According to UN statistics, U.S. military intervention in Syria has left at least 350,000 people dead, 12 million displaced and 14 million in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. The UN refers to the Syrian refugee problem as \"the biggest humanitarian and refugee crisis of our time\". According to estimates of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the war in Afghanistan, which lingered for more than two decades, has forced 2.6 million Afghans to flee the country and displaced 3.5 million.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In Europe, U.S. intervention in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the 1990s escalated ethnic tensions in the country. The wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo resulted in nearly 300,000 deaths and nearly three million refugees. In March 1999, NATO forces led by the United States blatantly bypassed the UN Security Council to carry out a 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia under the pretext of \"averting humanitarian disaster\", causing over 2,000 civilian deaths, over 6,000 injuries and around a million displaced people.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086U.S. military interventions around the world triggered a refugee crisis in Europe. It is widely held in Europe that U.S. interference and military operations in such countries as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria gave rise to waves of refugees, but it is Europe, not the United States, that received them. Most of the affected people fled to Europe in the wake of the Syrian refugee crisis, exacerbating anti-immigrant sentiments and right-wing populist movements in Europe. By contrast, the Republican administration in the United States was tough on taking Syrian refugees, bringing refugee admission to a 40-year low and categorically banning refugees from seven Islamic countries from entering the country. The Democratic administration urged the EU to admit some Afghan refugees, a move upsetting the EU which feared that another surge of Muslim refugees could again heighten the right-wing populist movements. French President Emmanuel Macron put it bluntly that Europe alone will not be able to assume the consequences of the current situation in Afghanistan.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In Latin America, long-time U.S. intervention in internal affairs led to instability and economic backwardness in the region. As a result, a large number of refugees and immigrants were forced to seek asylum and livelihood in the United States. To check the flow of immigration from Latin America, the United States forcefully expelled and repatriated refugees and immigrants, and made those attempting to leave stay in their country of origin. The United States' vehement expulsion and repatriation of Latino immigrants exacerbated instability, violent crime and humanitarian crisis in the region. \"The United States spent decades contributing to regime change and destabilization in Latin America,\" criticized Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives, \"We can't help set someone's house on fire and then blame them for fleeing.\"\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The United States and Latin American countries are at loggerheads over immigration and border issues. After being expelled from the United States, refugees and immigrants often become stranded in Mexico, posing a challenge to the country's ability to host and accommodate them and causing public security concerns for the Mexican government. While the United States keeps urging Mexico to do more to prevent its refugees and immigrants and those of other Central American countries from coming to the United States, Mexico blames the surge of refugees and immigrants on the U.S. immigration policy. In recent years, the Northern Triangle of Central America, i.e. Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras became the top source of refugees and immigrants to the United States. The U.S. government pressed the governments of the three countries and issued stern warnings to potential immigrants. Its tough stance sparked frustration in Central America and triggered backlash domestically.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The eastward expansion of NATO led by the United States is an important root cause of the Ukraine crisis. Being the initiator and biggest driver of the crisis, the United States cannot shirk off its responsibility for the sufferings of Ukrainian refugees. After the conflict between Russia and Ukraine started, however, the U.S. government suggested that Ukrainian refugees should stay in European countries or return to Ukraine as soon as possible, and was reluctant to take them in on a large scale. As of January 2023, UNHCR data indicated that more than 7.91 million Ukrainian refugees were registered across Europe. It was not until the end of July 2022 that the U.S. government claimed to have received 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, a number significantly dwarfed by Europe Union, and the real purpose of the U.S. move was actually for Ukrainian Americans to reunite with their families.\n\nConclusion\n\nA review of U.S. history would expose the country's cruel treatment of immigrants from almost all around the world, including people of African, Irish, Eastern European, Southern European, Jewish, Asian, Latino, and Muslim origins. The U.S. government interferes in the domestic affairs of other countries and launches wars across the world, creating large-scale humanitarian disasters and immigration crises while refusing to take responsibility and shifting the blame onto others. The United States needs to seriously reflect on its terrible record on the issue of refugees and immigrants and correct its course, and make real efforts to improve the situations of foreign refugees and immigrants in the country. It should stop all hegemonic and bullying practices, stop creating new crises, stop acting like a \"human rights guardian\", and stop using human rights as a pretext to smear and attack others.\n\n", "id": "5c9f81d9575f3de7a8026010d9a5a7d0"}

It has a severe impact on the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and seriously infringes on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and sends a seriously wrong signal to the separatist forces for \"Taiwan independence\". The move is extremely egregious in nature and will have extremely serious consequences. China will not sit idly by.\n\nThe U.S. government must be held accountable. For quite some time, the United States has said one thing but done the opposite, constantly distorted, altered, obscured and hollowed out the one-China principle\u00e2\u0080\u0082in an\u00e2\u0080\u0082attempt to cross the red line and make\u00e2\u0080\u0082\"breakthroughs\", and played the \"Taiwan card\" by hook or by crook. The U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0082even\u00e2\u0080\u0082went further to delete such\u00e2\u0080\u0082key expressions as \"Taiwan is a part of China\" from the its\u00e2\u0080\u0082State Department website, put Taiwan in its so-called \"Indo-Pacific strategy\", blatantly upgrade its ties with Taiwan, increase arms sales to the Taiwan region, openly clamor for helping\u00e2\u0080\u0082Taiwan improve \"asymmetric military capability\" and support\u00e2\u0080\u0082separatist activities for \"Taiwan independence\".\n\nInstead of restraining\u00e2\u0080\u0082Pelosi's willful behavior and stopping\u00e2\u0080\u0082her retrogressive and perverse acts,\u00e2\u0080\u0082the U.S. government has connived at\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082her having her own way, which escalated tensions across the Taiwan Strait and seriously undermined China-U.S. relations.\n\nXie Feng pointed out\u00e2\u0080\u0082that\u00e2\u0080\u0082the U.S. side must\u00e2\u0080\u0082pay the price for its wrongdoings. China will\u00e2\u0080\u0082take necessary\u00e2\u0080\u0082actions and respond with firm countermeasures. We mean what we say. Anyone who attempts to seek political gains by manipulating the Taiwan question will go nowhere. Anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0082who harbors the illusion of gaining political legacy by playing the \"Taiwan card\" will be nailed to the historical pillar of ignominy. The United States should immediately correct\u00e2\u0080\u0082its mistakes and take credible measures to undo the adverse impact\u00e2\u0080\u0082of Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. The U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0082must not go further down the wrong path, escalating tensions and making the situation across the Taiwan Strait and China-U.S. relations irreparable.\n\nThe Chinese side once again urges\u00e2\u0080\u0082the United States to stop its dangerous moves before it's too late, stop stirring up troubles on the Taiwan question, stop conniving at and\u00e2\u0080\u0082abetting \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces, stop playing the \"Taiwan card\" in any form and using Taiwan to contain China, and stop meddling on\u00e2\u0080\u0082Taiwan and interfering in China's internal affairs. The United States must take concrete actions to strictly observe\u00e2\u0080\u0082the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiqu\u00c3\u00a9s, deliver on the \"five noes\" commitment made by the U.S. leadership (i.e. not seek a \"new Cold War\"; not seek to change China's system; the revitalization of its alliances is not against China; not support \"Taiwan independence\"; not look for conflict with China), and not go further down the wrong and dangerous path.\n\nXie Feng stressed that the trend of the times cannot be reversed, and the will of the people \u00e2\u0080\u0082is\u00e2\u0080\u0082not to be defied. Those who play with fire will perish by it. Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. The Chinese people will not be scared by evils, intimidated by pressure, nor misled by fallacies. In the minds of the Chinese people, nothing is more sacred than protecting China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and nothing is more important than safeguarding national unity and realizing national reunification.\u00e2\u0080\u0082No country, no forces\u00e2\u0080\u0082and no individual should ever underestimate the firm resolve, strong will and great capability of the Chinese government and people to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to achieve national reunification and rejuvenation.\n\n", "id": "5ca9c3d5b5c938b28bdd2a0dae603ef2"}

China will stay in close communication with relevant parties in the international community to actively promote talks for peace.\n\nZhai Jun said that the fundamental way to resolve the conflicts between Palestine and Israel is to implement the two-state solution and establish an independent state of Palestine. The international community needs to act with a stronger sense of urgency, heed the legitimate concerns of Palestine, and take concrete steps to fulfill the pledge to the Palestinian people. Major countries with influence need to step up to their responsibilities, take a just position, and play their due part in facilitating the resumption of peace talks between Palestine and Israel on the basis of the two-state solution. China will continue to make relentless efforts to facilitate a proper resolution of the Palestinian question at an early date.\n\n", "id": "637686efbfe83dffb1eea8b26ce3e97e"}

The GSI provides China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals for tackling global security issues, addressing the security deficit in the world and promoting common security for humanity, and receives wide-range applause and positive response from the international community.\n\nNong Rong said that the GSI provides guidance for the thinking and actions to safeguard and promote world peace and security, and has yielded a series of positive progress and outcomes over the past year since it was put forth. Not long ago, China released the Global Security Initiative Concept Paper, listing 20 priorities of cooperation on the most urgent and pressing international security concerns at present, and putting forward suggestions and outlooks on platforms and mechanisms of cooperation. As of today, more than 80 countries and international organizations have appreciated and supported the GSI. The GSI has clearly incorporated more than 20 bilateral and multilateral documents on exchanges between China and relevant countries and organizations. Guided by the philosophies and the principles of the GSI, China has made relentless efforts to promote the political settlement of various hotspot issues and remained actively committed to cooperation with all other parties in non-traditional security areas including pandemic response, counter-terrorism, biology, cyberspace, food, and climate change.\n\n\n\nNong Rong said that the Asia-Pacific serves as an anchor of stability for world peace and a powerhouse for development. The current security situation maintains general stability, and at the same time faces complex and grave challenges. Relevant philosophies and principles of the GSI have shown a clear direction and pathway for all parties to jointly safeguard security and stability and achieve sustainable prosperity in the Asia-Pacific. China calls on all parties to jointly consolidate the political foundation, strengthen the economic base, improve institutional guarantees and maintain an enabling environment for enduring peace and stability in Asia-Pacific. Any country that attempts to create camp politics, build an Asia-Pacific version of NATO and wage a new Cold War in the Asia-Pacific region will stand on the opposite side of the Asia-Pacific countries dedicated to peaceful development, which will not be allowed by\u00e2\u0080\u0082the times or accepted by people.\n\n\n\nNong Rong emphasized that as identified by the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the central task of the CPC on the new journey in the new era will be to lead the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in a concerted effort to realize the second centenary goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. At China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo sessions\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082convened this year, President Xi Jinping stressed that we should accelerate the advancement of Chinese modernization. Chinese modernization will neither tread the old path of colonization and plunder, nor the beaten\u00e2\u0080\u0082path of seeking\u00e2\u0080\u0082hegemony once they grow strong\u00e2\u0080\u0082taken by some countries. What China pursues is a right course of peaceful development. China welcomes the active participation in the GSI cooperation from all members of the international community who love peace and dedicate themselves to development, jointly substantiate the content and practices of the GSI, work in cooperation to respond to various security challenges, and make new contributions to defending peace and tranquility in Asia-Pacific and safeguarding world peace and stability.\n\nThe sub-forum themed \u00e2\u0080\u009cGlobal Geopolitical Outlook\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082was hosted by the Secretariat of Boao Forum for Asia.

By holding this conference on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the opening for signature of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), China, as a State Party, aims to pool wisdom, encourage various sides to take stock of the history of the Convention and revisit its purposes and principles, and promote global maritime cooperation and governance.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nMore than 200 delegates, including government officials, representatives of international organizations, experts and scholars, have attended the conference. State Councilor Wang Yi delivered important remarks, in which he expounded on China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position on the Convention, and called on various sides to act as a community with a shared future to promote sustainable development of the sea, champion dialogue and consultation to maintain peace and tranquility of the sea, promote international cooperation to preserve the ecological environment of the sea, and uphold the international rule of law to jointly usher in a new journey of maritime governance.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Miguel de Serpa Soares encouraged efforts to address new challenges including marine biodiversity and marine pollution in the spirit of the Convention. I also made a keynote report on China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s implementation of UNCLOS in full and in good faith and its active contribution to global maritime cooperation and governance. Participants will have in-depth discussions on the achievements and contribution of the Convention over the past four decades and new frontiers of the Law of the Sea, and explore the pathway to maritime cooperation and governance.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nQ2:What role has the Convention played in the past 40 years? Are there any problems and what is your expectation of it in the future?\n\nXie: The Convention is an extensive legal instrument on maritime affairs, which takes into account the interests of various types of countries, including coastal states, flag states and land-locked states. It has played an important role in helping mankind to understand, protect and utilize the ocean in a sustainable way. The three bodies established by the Convention, namely, the International Seabed Authority, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, have become important mechanisms for global maritime governance and provided useful platforms for discussing and resolving maritime issues.\n\nAt the same time, the Convention has not exhausted all issues related to the Law of the Sea. Matters such as historic rights and outlying archipelagos continue to be governed by customary international law. When the Convention was adopted 40 years ago, issues such as sea level rise, ocean acidification and unmanned vessels were not yet acute, so there is no specific provision in the Convention about such new issues. Also, in its implementation, there have been cases of misinterpretation and even abuse of its procedures, which have undermined the sanctity and authority of the Convention.\n\nThe Convention is an open, inclusive and ever-evolving legal framework. It affirms that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmatters not regulated by this Convention continue to be governed by the rules and principles of general international law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since the adoption of the Convention, two agreements, one on the international seabed and the other on fish stocks, have been concluded, and negotiations on an international agreement on maritime biodiversity are now well underway. As long as various sides abide by the spirit of the Convention and continue to enrich international maritime laws including UNCLOS, the Convention will surely continue to play an important role in future global maritime governance.\n\nQ3: As a State Party, how does China view the role of the Convention in settling disputes in the South China Sea?\n\nXie: It is China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consistent position that maritime disputes should be settled by the states directly concerned through negotiation and consultation on the basis of respecting historical facts and international law. This is in line with the Convention, and is also the successful experience of the majority of countries. It is the most effective way to peacefully settle maritime disputes.\n\nRegarding the role of the Convention in resolving disputes in the South China Sea, I would like to emphasize two points: First, relevant disputes involve not only maritime delimitation but also territorial issues. Territorial issues should be settled mainly based on international law such as the UN Charter, and in settling maritime disputes, relevant treaties and customary international law apart from the Convention should also be considered. Second, the dispute settlement mechanism of the Convention respects the voluntary choice of the parties to the dispute. In 2006, in accordance with the Convention, China solemnly declared that it excludes maritime delimitation among others from the compulsory procedures of UNCLOS. Meanwhile, there is a long-standing important consensus between China and relevant neighbouring countries that disputes should be settled through negotiation and consultation.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nIn 2000, China and Vietnam signed an agreement on maritime delimitation in the Beibu Gulf through negotiations. China is committed to making temporary arrangements with relevant countries on sea-related issues in the spirit of UNCLOS before relevant disputes are completely resolved. At present, China has established bilateral consultation mechanisms on maritime affairs with countries including the Philippines and Vietnam, and is actively promoting maritime joint development with neighboring countries. China seeks to build friendships and partnerships with its neighbors. We will continue to work with relevant countries and follow the dual-track approach jointly proposed by China and ASEAN countries, to boost maritime dialogue, exchanges and practical cooperation, properly manage differences, and promote prosperity and development in the South China Sea and the region. At the same time, we will continue to follow the guidance of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), and strive to reach at a faster pace an effective and substantive Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) that is consistent with international law including UNCLOS, so as to provide stronger institutional safeguards for managing differences and advancing cooperation.\n\nQ4: What efforts has China made for the adoption of the Convention and its implementation? How will China further promote the role of the Convention in the future?\n\nXie: China has always actively participated in, developed and contributed to the Convention and its institutions.\n\nAt present, the world is facing the combined impacts of changes unseen in a century and the COVID-19 pandemic, and the issues of marine environmental protection and sustainable development are becoming more prominent. China stands ready to work with various sides to continue championing the purposes and principles of UNCLOS, and carry forward the spirit of true multilateralism embodied in the Convention. It is important to take into account the interests of different countries and uphold humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common interests, and take credible steps to raise developing countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 capability of marine scientific research and governance. It is important to fully and accurately interpret and apply UNCLOS in good faith and in its entirety, discard the mindset of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmight is right\u00e2\u0080\u009d, oppose selective application of the Convention, uphold and advance an equitable and just international maritime order, and improve the global governance of the sea.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nQ5: The United States is not a party to UNCLOS. Nevertheless, it has accused China of violating the Convention on multiple occasions, and kept ramping up the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreedom of navigation operations\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the South China Sea to challenge China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights and claims. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your comment on this?\n\nXie: As early as during the negotiations on the Convention, the US dismissed the concerns of developing countries, persistently opposed taking the international seabed and its resources as the common heritage of mankind, and planned to set up another system outside UNCLOS to obstruct its adoption. While opposing the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) regime proposed by developing countries during the negotiations, the US has claimed the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest EEZ after the Convention was adopted.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nTill today, the US is yet to ratify the Convention, emphasizing that it is not subject to UNCLOS procedures. But at the same time, it has played up the supremacy of the Convention out of ulterior motives, arbitrarily used it as a tool to smear, contain and suppress other countries. The truth is that the US wants only the benefits of the Convention without fulfilling its obligations, and is saying one thing while doing another. It is in no position whatsoever to cite UNCLOS to accuse others.\n\nThe so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreedom of navigation operations\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the US are actually intended to boycott UNCLOS regimes such as the EEZ, maintain US maritime hegemony, and allow its warships and military flights to continue having their way without restraint on the sea. But in recent years, the US has put the blame on others instead, and frequently challenged other countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 maritime claims under the pretext of freedom of navigation, without any basis in international law including the Law of the Sea. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position and claims concerning the South China Sea have solid historical and legal grounds. There has never been and will never be any problem with the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. The US has breached general international law principles, including the prohibition on the threat or use of force, by flexing its military muscle to challenge other countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 claims and threaten other countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 security and maritime rights and interests. Such unlawful attempts to pursue the law of the jungle at sea run counter to the trend of the times, and have been understandably firmly rejected by China and other members of the international community.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\n", "id": "72abe74814de3d9b9af16a4c7add8449"}

Cultural Hegemony\u00e2\u0080\u0094Spreading False Narratives\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince becoming the world's most powerful country after the two world wars and the Cold War, the United States has acted more boldly to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, pursue, maintain and abuse hegemony, advance subversion and infiltration, and willfully wage wars, bringing harm to the international community.\n\nThe United States has developed a hegemonic playbook to stage \"color revolutions,\" instigate regional disputes, and even directly launch wars under the guise of promoting democracy, freedom and human rights. Clinging to the Cold War mentality, the United States has ramped up bloc politics and stoked conflict and confrontation. It has overstretched the concept of national security, abused export controls and forced unilateral sanctions upon others. It has taken a selective approach to international law and rules, utilizing or discarding them as it sees fit, and has sought to impose rules that serve its own interests in the name of upholding a \"rules-based international order.\"\n\nThis report, by presenting the relevant facts, seeks to expose the U.S. abuse of hegemony in the political, military, economic, financial, technological and cultural fields, and to draw greater international attention to the perils of the U.S. practices to world peace and stability and the well-being of all peoples.\n\nI. Political Hegemony -- Throwing Its Weight Around\n\nThe United States has long been attempting to mold other countries and the world order with its own values and political system in the name of promoting democracy and human rights.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Instances of U.S. interference in other countries' internal affairs abound. In the name of \"promoting democracy,\" the United States practiced a \"Neo-Monroe Doctrine\" in Latin America, instigated \"color revolutions\" in Eurasia, and orchestrated the \"Arab Spring\" in West Asia and North Africa, bringing chaos and disaster to many countries.\n\nIn 1823, the United States announced the Monroe Doctrine. While touting an \"America for the Americans,\" what it truly wanted was an \"America for the United States.\"\n\nSince then, the policies of successive U.S. governments toward Latin America and the Caribbean Region have been riddled with political interference, military intervention and regime subversion. From its 61-year hostility toward and blockade of Cuba to its overthrow of the Allende government of Chile, U.S. policy on this region has been built on one maxim-those who submit will prosper; those who resist shall perish.\n\nThe year 2003 marked the beginning of a succession of \"color revolutions\" -- the \"Rose Revolution\" in Georgia, the \"Orange Revolution\" in Ukraine and the \"Tulip Revolution\" in Kyrgyzstan. The U.S. Department of State openly admitted playing a \"central role\" in these \"regime changes.\" The United States also interfered in the internal affairs of the Philippines, ousting President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. in 1986 and President Joseph Estrada in 2001 through the so-called \"People Power Revolutions.\"\n\nIn January 2023, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo released his new book Never Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love. He revealed in it that the United States had plotted to intervene in Venezuela. The plan was to force the Maduro government to reach an agreement with the opposition, deprive Venezuela of its ability to sell oil and gold for foreign exchange, exert high pressure on its economy, and influence the 2018 presidential election.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The U.S. exercises double standards on international rules. Placing its self-interest first, the United States has walked away from international treaties and organizations, and put its domestic law above international law. In April 2017, the Trump administration announced that it would cut off all U.S. funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) with the excuse that the organization \"supports, or participates in the management of a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\" The United States quit UNESCO twice in 1984 and 2017. In 2017, it announced leaving the Paris Agreement on climate change. In 2018, it announced its exit from the UN Human Rights Council, citing the organization's \"bias\" against Israel and failure to protect human rights effectively. In 2019, the United States announced its withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty to seek unfettered development of advanced weapons. In 2020, it announced pulling out of the Treaty on Open Skies.\n\nThe United States has also been a stumbling block to biological arms control by opposing negotiations on a verification protocol for the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and impeding international verification of countries' activities relating to biological weapons. As the only country in possession of a chemical weapons stockpile, the United States has repeatedly delayed the destruction of chemical weapons and remained reluctant in fulfilling its obligations. It has become the biggest obstacle to realizing \"a world free of chemical weapons.\"\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The United States is piecing together small blocs through its alliance system. It has been forcing an \"Indo-Pacific Strategy\" onto the Asia-Pacific region, assembling exclusive clubs like the Five Eyes, the Quad and AUKUS, and forcing regional countries to take sides. Such practices are essentially meant to create division in the region, stoke confrontation and undermine peace.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The U.S. arbitrarily passes judgment on democracy in other countries, and fabricates a false narrative of \"democracy versus authoritarianism\" to incite estrangement, division, rivalry and confrontation. In December 2021, the United States hosted the first \"Summit for Democracy,\" which drew criticism and opposition from many countries for making a mockery of the spirit of democracy and dividing the world. In March 2023, the United States will host another \"Summit for Democracy,\" which remains unwelcome and will again find no support.\n\nII. Military Hegemony -- Wanton Use of Force\n\nThe history of the United States is characterized by violence and expansion. Since it gained independence in 1776, the United States has constantly sought expansion by force: it slaughtered Indians, invaded Canada, waged a war against Mexico, instigated the American-Spanish War, and annexed Hawaii. After World War II, the wars either provoked or launched by the United States included the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the War in Afghanistan, the Iraq War, the Libyan War and the Syrian War, abusing its military hegemony to pave the way for expansionist objectives. In recent years, the U.S. average annual military budget has exceeded 700 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 40 percent of the world's total, more than the 15 countries behind it combined. The United States has about 800 overseas military bases, with 173,000 troops deployed in 159 countries.\n\nAccording to the book America Invades: How We've Invaded or been Militarily Involved with almost Every Country on Earth, the United States has fought or been militarily involved with almost all the 190-odd countries recognized by the United Nations with only three exceptions. The three countries were \"spared\" because the United States did not find them on the map.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 As former U.S. President Jimmy Carter put it, the United States is undoubtedly the most warlike nation in the history of the world. According to a Tufts University report, \"Introducing the Military Intervention Project: A new Dataset on U.S. Military Interventions, 1776-2019,\" the United States undertook nearly 400 military interventions globally between those years, 34 percent of which were in Latin America and the Caribbean, 23 percent in East Asia and the Pacific, 14 percent in the Middle East and North Africa, and 13 percent in Europe. Currently, its military intervention in the Middle East and North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa is on the rise.\n\nAlex Lo, a South China Morning Post columnist, pointed out that the United States has rarely distinguished between diplomacy and war since its founding. It overthrew democratically elected governments in many developing countries in the 20th century and immediately replaced them with pro-American puppet regimes. Today, in Ukraine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Pakistan and Yemen, the United States is repeating its old tactics of waging proxy, low-intensity, and drone wars.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 U.S. military hegemony has caused humanitarian tragedies. Since 2001, the wars and military operations launched by the United States in the name of fighting terrorism have claimed over 900,000 lives with some 335,000 of them civilians, injured millions and displaced tens of millions. The 2003 Iraq War resulted in some 200,000 to 250,000 civilian deaths, including over 16,000 directly killed by the U.S. military, and left more than a million homeless.\n\nThe United States has created 37 million refugees around the world. Since 2012, the number of Syrian refugees alone has increased tenfold. Between 2016 and 2019, 33,584 civilian deaths were documented in the Syrian fightings, including 3,833 killed by U.S.-led coalition bombings, half of them women and children. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) reported on 9 November 2018 that the air strikes launched by U.S. forces on Raqqa alone killed 1,600 Syrian civilians.\n\nThe two-decades-long war in Afghanistan devastated the country. A total of 47,000 Afghan civilians and 66,000 to 69,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers unrelated to the September 11 attacks were killed in U.S. military operations, and more than 10 million people were displaced. The war in Afghanistan destroyed the foundation of economic development there and plunged the Afghan people into destitution. After the \"Kabul debacle\" in 2021, the United States announced that it would freeze some 9.5 billion dollars in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank, a move considered as \"pure looting.\"\n\nIn September 2022, Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu commented at a rally that the United States has waged a proxy war in Syria, turned Afghanistan into an opium field and heroin factory, thrown Pakistan into turmoil, and left Libya in incessant civil unrest. The United States does whatever it takes to rob and enslave the people of any country with underground resources.\n\nThe United States has also adopted appalling methods in war. During the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War, the United States used massive quantities of chemical and biological weapons as well as cluster bombs, fuel-air bombs, graphite bombs and depleted uranium bombs, causing enormous damage on civilian facilities, countless civilian casualties and lasting environmental pollution.\n\nIII. Economic Hegemony -- Looting and Exploitation\n\nAfter World War II, the United States led efforts to set up the Bretton Woods System, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which, together with the Marshall Plan, formed the international monetary system centered around the U.S. dollar. In addition, the United States has also established institutional hegemony in the international economic and financial sector by manipulating the weighted voting systems, rules and arrangements of international organizations including \"approval by 85 percent majority,\" and its domestic trade laws and regulations. By taking advantage of the dollar's status as the major international reserve currency, the United States is basically collecting \"seigniorage\" from around the world; and using its control over international organizations, it coerces other countries into serving America's political and economic strategy.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The United States exploits the world's wealth with the help of \"seigniorage.\" It costs only about 17 cents to produce a 100 dollar bill, but other countries had to pony up 100 dollar of actual goods in order to obtain one. It was pointed out more than half a century ago, that the United States enjoyed exorbitant privilege and deficit without tears created by its dollar, and used the worthless paper note to plunder the resources and factories of other nations.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The hegemony of U.S. dollar is the main source of instability and uncertainty in the world economy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States abused its global financial hegemony and injected trillions of dollars into the global market, leaving other countries, especially emerging economies, to pay the price. In 2022, the Fed ended its ultra-easy monetary policy and turned to aggressive interest rate hike, causing turmoil in the international financial market and substantial depreciation of other currencies such as the Euro, many of which dropped to a 20-year low. As a result, a large number of developing countries were challenged by high inflation, currency depreciation and capital outflows. This was exactly what Nixon's secretary of the treasury John Connally once remarked, with self-satisfaction yet sharp precision, that \"the dollar is our currency, but it is your problem.\"\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 With its control over international economic and financial organizations, the United States imposes additional conditions to their assistance to other countries. In order to reduce obstacles to U.S. capital inflow and speculation, the recipient countries are required to advance financial liberalization and open up financial markets so that their economic policies would fall in line with America's strategy. According to the Review of International Political Economy, along with the 1,550 debt relief programs extended by the IMF to its 131 member countries from 1985 to 2014, as many as 55,465 additional political conditions had been attached.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The United States willfully suppresses its opponents with economic coercion. In the 1980s, to eliminate the economic threat posed by Japan, and to control and use the latter in service of America's strategic goal of confronting the Soviet Union and dominating the world, the United States leveraged its hegemonic financial power against Japan, and concluded the Plaza Accord. As a result, Yen was pushed up, and Japan was pressed to open up its financial market and reform its financial system. The Plaza Accord dealt a heavy blow to the growth momentum of the Japanese economy, leaving Japan to what was later called \"three lost decades.\"\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 America's economic and financial hegemony has become a geopolitical weapon. Doubling down on unilateral sanctions and \"long-arm jurisdiction,\" the United States has enacted such domestic laws as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, and the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, and introduced a series of executive orders to sanction specific countries, organizations or individuals. Statistics show that U.S. sanctions against foreign entities increased by 933 percent from 2000 to 2021. The Trump administration alone has imposed more than 3,900 sanctions, which means three sanctions per day. So far, the United States had or has imposed economic sanctions on nearly 40 countries across the world, including Cuba, China, Russia, the DPRK, Iran and Venezuela, affecting nearly half of the world's population. \"The United States of America\" has turned itself into \"the United States of Sanctions.\" And \"long-arm jurisdiction\" has been reduced to nothing but a tool for the United States to use its means of state power to suppress economic competitors and interfere in normal international business. This is a serious departure from the principles of liberal market economy that the United States has long boasted.\n\nIV. Technological Hegemony -- Monopoly and Suppression\n\nThe United States seeks to deter other countries' scientific, technological and economic development by wielding monopoly power, suppression measures and technology restrictions in high-tech fields.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The United States monopolizes intellectual property in the name of protection. Taking advantage of the weak position of other countries, especially developing ones, on intellectual property rights and the institutional vacancy in relevant fields, the United States reaps excessive profits through monopoly. In 1994, the United States pushed forward the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), forcing the Americanized process and standards in intellectual property protection in an attempt to solidify its monopoly on technology.\n\nIn the 1980s, to contain the development of Japan's semiconductor industry, the United States launched the \"301\" investigation, built bargaining power in bilateral negotiations through multilateral agreements, threatened to label Japan as conducting unfair trade, and imposed retaliatory tariffs, forcing Japan to sign the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement. As a result, Japanese semiconductor enterprises were almost completely driven out of global competition, and their market share dropped from 50 percent to 10 percent. Meanwhile, with the support of the U.S. government, a large number of U.S. semiconductor enterprises took the opportunity and grabbed larger market share.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The United States politicizes, weaponizes technological issues and uses them as ideological tools. Overstretching the concept of national security, the United States mobilized state power to suppress and sanction Chinese company Huawei, restricted the entry of Huawei products into the U.S. market, cut off its supply of chips and operating systems, and coerced other countries to ban Huawei from undertaking local 5G network construction. It even talked Canada into unwarrantedly detaining Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou for nearly three years.\n\nThe United States has fabricated a slew of excuses to clamp down on China's high-tech enterprises with global competitiveness, and has put more than 1,000 Chinese enterprises on sanction lists. In addition, the United States has also imposed controls on biotechnology, artificial intelligence and other high-end technologies, reinforced export restrictions, tightened investment screening, suppressed Chinese social media apps such as TikTok and WeChat, and lobbied the Netherlands and Japan to restrict exports of chips and related equipment or technology to China.\n\nThe United States has also practiced double standards in its policy on China-related technological professionals. To sideline and suppress Chinese researchers, since June 2018, visa validity has been shortened for Chinese students majoring in certain high-tech-related disciplines, repeated cases have occurred where Chinese scholars and students going to the United States for exchange programs and study were unjustifiably denied and harassed, and large-scale investigation on Chinese scholars working in the United States was carried out.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The United States solidifies its technological monopoly in the name of protecting democracy. By building small blocs on technology such as the \"chips alliance\" and \"clean network,\" the United States has put \"democracy\" and \"human rights\" labels on high-technology, and turned technological issues into political and ideological issues, so as to fabricate excuses for its technological blockade against other countries. In May 2019, the United States enlisted 32 countries to the Prague 5G Security Conference in the Czech Republic and issued the Prague Proposal in an attempt to exclude China's 5G products. In April 2020, then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the \"5G clean path,\" a plan designed to build technological alliance in the 5G field with partners bonded by their shared ideology on democracy and the need to protect \"cyber security.\" The measures, in essence, are the U.S. attempts to maintain its technological hegemony through technological alliances.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The United States abuses its technological hegemony by carrying out cyber attacks and eavesdropping. The United States has long been notorious as an \"empire of hackers,\" blamed for its rampant acts of cyber theft around the world. It has all kinds of means to enforce pervasive cyber attacks and surveillance, including using analog base station signals to access mobile phones for data theft, manipulating mobile apps, infiltrating cloud servers, and stealing through undersea cables. The list goes on.\n\nU.S. surveillance is indiscriminate. All can be targets of its surveillance, be they rivals or allies, even leaders of allied countries such as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and several French Presidents. Cyber surveillance and attacks launched by the United States such as \"Prism,\" \"Dirtbox,\" \"Irritant Horn\" and \"Telescreen Operation\" are all proof that the United States is closely monitoring its allies and partners. Such eavesdropping on allies and partners has already caused worldwide outrage. Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, a website that has exposed U.S. surveillance programs, said that \"do not expect a global surveillance superpower to act with honor or respect. There is only one rule: there are no rules.\"\n\nV. Cultural Hegemony -- Spreading False Narratives\n\nThe global expansion of American culture is an important part of its external strategy. The United States has often used cultural tools to strengthen and maintain its hegemony in the world.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The United States embeds American values in its products such as movies. American values and lifestyle are a tied product to its movies and TV shows, publications, media content, and programs by the government-funded non-profit cultural institutions. It thus shapes a cultural and public opinion space in which American culture reigns and maintains cultural hegemony. In his article The Americanization of the World, John Yemma, an American scholar, exposed the real weapons in U.S. cultural expansion: the Hollywood, the image design factories on Madison Avenue and the production lines of Mattel Company and Coca-Cola.\n\nThere are various vehicles the United States uses to keep its cultural hegemony. American movies are the most used; they now occupy more than 70 percent of the world's market share. The United States skilfully exploits its cultural diversity to appeal to various ethnicities. When Hollywood movies descend on the world, they scream the American values tied to them.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 American cultural hegemony not only shows itself in \"direct intervention,\" but also in \"media infiltration\" and as \"a trumpet for the world.\" U.S.-dominated Western media has a particularly important role in shaping global public opinion in favor of U.S. meddling in the internal affairs of other countries.\n\nThe U.S. government strictly censors all social media companies and demands their obedience. Twitter CEO Elon Musk admitted on 27 December 2022 that all social media platforms work with the U.S. government to censor content, reported Fox Business Network. Public opinion in the United States is subject to government intervention to restrict all unfavorable remarks. Google often makes pages disappear.\n\nU.S. Department of Defense manipulates social media. In December 2022, The Intercept, an independent U.S. investigative website, revealed that in July 2017, U.S. Central Command official Nathaniel Kahler instructed Twitter's public policy team to augment the presence of 52 Arabic-language accounts on a list he sent, six of which were to be given priority. One of the six was dedicated to justifying U.S. drone attacks in Yemen, such as by claiming that the attacks were precise and killed only terrorists, not civilians. Following Kahler's directive, Twitter put those Arabic-language accounts on a \"white list\" to amplify certain messages.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The United States practices double standards on the freedom of the press. It brutally suppresses and silences media of other countries by various means. The United States and Europe bar mainstream Russian media such as Russia Today and the Sputnik from their countries. Platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube openly restrict official accounts of Russia. Netflix, Apple and Google have removed Russian channels and applications from their services and app stores. Unprecedented draconian censorship is imposed on Russia-related contents.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The United States abuses its cultural hegemony to instigate \"peaceful evolution\" in socialist countries. It sets up news media and cultural outfits targeting socialist countries. It pours staggering amounts of public funds into radio and TV networks to support their ideological infiltration, and these mouthpieces bombard socialist countries in dozens of languages with inflammatory propaganda day and night.\n\nThe United States uses misinformation as a spear to attack other countries, and has built an industrial chain around it: there are groups and individuals making up stories, and peddling them worldwide to mislead public opinion with the support of nearly limitless financial resources.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile a just cause wins its champion wide support, an unjust one condemns its pursuer to be an outcast. The hegemonic, domineering, and bullying practices of using strength to intimidate the weak, taking from others by force and subterfuge, and playing zero-sum games are exerting grave harm. The historical trends of peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit are unstoppable. The United States has been overriding truth with its power and trampling justice to serve self-interest. These unilateral, egoistic and regressive hegemonic practices have drawn growing, intense criticism and opposition from the international community.\n\nCountries need to respect each other and treat each other as equals. Big countries should behave in a manner befitting their status and take the lead in pursuing a new model of state-to-state relations featuring dialogue and partnership, not confrontation or alliance. China opposes all forms of hegemonism and power politics, and rejects interference in other countries' internal affairs. The United States must conduct serious soul-searching. It must critically examine what it has done, let go of its arrogance and prejudice, and quit its hegemonic, domineering and bullying practices.\n\n", "id": "72bc48b896403e14b1efa13536433fad"}

The two sides had a friendly and in-depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and international and regional issues of common concern.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that China and the Maldives enjoy a long history of friendly exchanges. The ancient Maritime Silk Road has long linked the two peoples. Over 600 years ago, Zheng He, a Chinese navigator in the Ming Dynasty, visited the Maldives twice with his fleet, and the King of the Maldives sent emissaries to China on many occasions. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the Maldives in 1972, bilateral exchanges and cooperation have been deepened and substantiated with a strong momentum of development. China is ready to work with the Maldives to take the opportunity of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties to deepen the future-oriented comprehensive friendly cooperative partnership between China and the Maldives, advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and implement the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative.\n\nAzeema made positive comments on bilateral relations and thanked China for its great contribution to the Maldives' economic and social development, infrastructure construction and pandemic response, saying that the Maldives and China are sincere partners of mutual assistance. The China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, social housing and other China-aided projects have demonstrated the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Maldivian people and set milestones for bilateral relations. The sound relations and strong mutual trust between the Maldives and China are rooted in the time-honored traditional friendship and adherence to the principles of sovereign equality and mutual respect. The Maldives firmly pursues the one-China principle and will continue to firmly support China's efforts to safeguard its core interests.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that at the recent G7 Summit, some countries proposed the \"Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment\" (PGII) as an alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative. More investment and financing in infrastructure\u00e2\u0080\u0082are welcome;\u00e2\u0080\u0082the more the better. Positive efforts of all parties can complement each other. However, there is no vision or sense in claiming to \"replace\" others' good things and thereby resorting to vicious competition,\u00e2\u0080\u0082slander\u00e2\u0080\u0082and blocking. In fact, they can't make it. Certain country has also launched \"Blue Dot Network\", \"Build Back Better World\" and \"Indo-Pacific Economic Framework\", all of which present \"three formats\". The first one is the administrative format, which is issued by the administrative department, but is hard to be approved by Congress and is hardly sustainable. The second one is the \"cartoon format\", that is, there are more Barmecide feasts, frames and promises. It is questionable how much money can be offered and whether it can be implemented. The third one is the \"unilateral format\", that is, it serves a country's unilateral needs, especially the needs of geopolitical strategy, and is based on the country's standards, rules and values rather than equality and mutual benefit.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that as a Maldivian proverb says, \"The robber's closet is tightly closed.\" Scheming people always make malicious guesses about others. They are trying to hide their conspiracies from the public. The U.S. \"Indo-Pacific Strategy\", which prioritizes itself over other countries, security over the economy, exclusiveness over inclusiveness, and words over actions, is unlikely to bring benefits to countries in the region. Asian and developing countries should work together to prevent the development agenda from being marginalized, regional cooperation from being politicized and ideologized, and multilateral initiatives and regional cooperation mechanisms from being fragmented and being used as tools to create camps. China and the Maldives are partners of mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual assistance. He hopes and believes that the Maldives will guard against the Cold War mentality and unilateralism and safeguard the common interests of China, the Maldives and other developing countries.\n\nAzeema said, maintaining regional peace and stability serves the interests of small- and medium-sized countries. China-Maldives friendship should not be interfered with by any third party. The Maldives will remain vigilant against the geopolitical plots of relevant countries. The Maldives appreciates President Xi Jinping's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind,\u00e2\u0080\u0082and stands ready to work with China to jointly safeguard regional peace and development.\n\nLiu Jinsong presented Azeema with President Xi Jinping's keynote speech at the Opening Ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum, and his remarks at the 14th BRICS Summit and the High-level Dialogue on Global Development as well as the Global Development Report in English.

Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng attended and addressed the event.

Xie noted that the 20th CPC National Congress, which has just successfully concluded in Beijing, is a meeting of great importance. It takes place at a critical time as the country embarks on a new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects and advance toward the Second Centenary Goal. The Congress has charted the course and established the guide to action for the cause of the Party and the country on the new journey of the new era and for realizing the Second Centenary Goal. It has also made clear to the world, now at a crossroads in history, the firm choice China has made, and sent a strong message of the times to promote world peace and development and build a human community with a shared future.\n\n\n\nXie Feng said that the exhibition themed \"Forging Ahead in the New Era\" has displayed the historic achievements and changes in the cause of the Party and the country over the past 10 years of the new era, which are the result of the collective dedication and hard work of the Party and the people, and which would not have been possible without the support and cooperation of the international community. Xie noted that many diplomatic envoys have witnessed, participated in and contributed to China's success of development. He was confident that after visiting this exhibition, they will have a more direct and profound understanding of the CPC's original aspiration and founding mission, China's rapid development, and the Chinese people's strenuous and concerted efforts over the past decade, and they will be able to more fully and profoundly appreciate the historic contributions China has made to the lofty cause of peace and development of mankind.\n\nXie Feng said that under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the Chinese people are striving in unity to build a modern socialist country in all respects and advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts. Chinese modernization is socialist modernization pursued under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. It contains elements that are common to the modernization processes of all countries, but it is more characterized by features that are unique to the Chinese context. China cannot develop in isolation from the world, and the world also needs China for its development. On the new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects, China will remain committed to its fundamental national policy of opening to the outside world and pursue a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up, and strive to create new opportunities for the world with its own development. China will adhere to the right course of economic globalization, strive to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and advance bilateral, regional, and multilateral cooperation. China will remain committed to its foreign policy goals of upholding world peace and promoting common development, and dedicate itself to promoting a human community with a shared future, and working with other countries to create an even brighter future for mankind.\n\n\n\nForeign diplomatic envoys extended warm congratulations on the successful conclusion of the 20th CPC National Congress, noting that China has scored historic achievements in development over the past decade, and made great contributions to global governance, poverty alleviation, safeguarding regional and world peace and security, and promoting common development.

Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng attended the inauguration ceremony via video link and delivered a speech. Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China Yin Li, Governor of Fujian Province Zhao Long, Executive Vice Governor Guo Ningning, Vice Administrator of the National Rural Revitalization Administration Xia Gengsheng, Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Fiji and Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation Veena Kumar Bhatnagar as well as diplomatic envoys to China and representatives of Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Samoa, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and other Pacific Island countries were present.\n\nXie Feng said in the speech that last September, President Xi Jinping said in his phone conversation with leaders of Pacific Island countries (PICs) that China planned to set up a China-Pacific Island Countries Poverty Alleviation and Development Cooperation Center to help PICs to find the path of poverty alleviation and development suited to their national conditions. At the first China-Pacific Island Countries Foreign Ministers' Meeting last October, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced the launch of setting up the center. This is a vivid practice of China's active implementation of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and participation in international poverty alleviation cooperation, and an important measure to help PICs achieve development and revitalization.\n\nXie Feng said, poverty eradication is the common aspiration of mankind and an important mission of developing countries. Poverty alleviation and development are like two wheels of a vehicle and the two wings of a bird, which supplement each other. Poverty alleviation makes way for better development; without development, there will be a return to poverty. President Xi Jinping solemnly declared at the Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China that China has built a moderately prosperous society in all respects and has brought about a historic resolution to the problem of absolute poverty. China has realized the poverty alleviation goal under the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ten years ahead of schedule, creating a \"China example\" of poverty alleviation. While eradicating poverty domestically, China has also actively fulfilled its international responsibility for poverty alleviation and provided assistance to other developing countries to the best of its ability, and has always been an active advocate and strong promoter of international poverty alleviation and development. Last year, President Xi Jinping put forward the GDI, which prioritizes poverty alleviation as a key area of cooperation. The GDI meets the urgent expectation of the international community for poverty eradication and meets the common aspiration of people around the world for a better life.\n\nXie Feng said, Fujian Province, a large maritime province and the birthplace of the Austronesian language family, enjoys geographical proximity, cultural affinity and complementary development advantages with PICs. As early as 2000, when President Xi Jinping served as the Governor of Fujian Province, he personally promoted the establishment of sister-province relations between Fujian Province and the Eastern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea, and the implementation of Juncao and upland rice technical assistance projects in Papua New Guinea. At present, the Juncao project has spread from Papua New Guinea to many island countries, raising the income of local farmers and generating fine economic and social benefits. It has become a gold-lettered signboard of poverty alleviation and development cooperation between China and PICs. By locating the center in Fujian, China aims to give full play to Fujian's unique advantages, work with PICs to set a new exemplary model for South-South cooperation on poverty alleviation, and make greater contributions to poverty alleviation and development in PICs.\n\nXie Feng said, China is always a member of the developing world, and we have stood and will continue to stand with developing countries. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties half a century ago, China has always treated PICs as equals and sincerely helped them to pursue development, revitalization and take control of their own destiny. PICs are not the \"backyard\" or \"sphere of influence\" of any country. Their sovereign dignity should be fully respected and their right to development should be fully guaranteed. China is ready to contribute its strength to the development of PICs and welcomes them aboard the express train of China's development. China will always be a good friend sharing the same goal, a good brother sharing weal and woe, and a good partner forging ahead together of PICs on the path of development and revitalization. China is ready to work with PICs to institutionalize and standardize the operation of the center under the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, build more brand projects, and continue to improve the well-being of the people of PICs through tangible cooperation outcomes.\n\n\n\n", "id": "83812cefc09138198892f6dc9fb076b4"}

This is another embodiment of the ironclad friendship between China and Pakistan and the concrete practice of building a China-Pakistan community with a shared future.\n\nLiu Jinsong stressed that China attaches great importance to the disaster in Pakistan. The Chinese leaders have sent messages of condolence to their Pakistani counterparts. The Chinese government has decided to provide urgently needed supplies, including tents, for Pakistan in emergency aid. The Red Cross Society of China has made donations to the Pakistani Red Crescent Society. Sub-national governments, institutions and people in China have also expressed sympathy and support in various forms.

China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emergency assistance, which came in time, is of vital importance to Pakistan. Pakistan is ready to work closely with China to make good use of the aid materials.\n\nHaque also said, I had visited Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and witnessed social stability, ethnic unity, freedom of religious belief and respect and protection of ethnic-minority cultures in Xinjiang.

The one-China principle has strict connotations, that is, there is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China, and countries that have established diplomatic relations with China shall not have\u00e2\u0080\u0082any form of official exchanges\u00e2\u0080\u0082with Taiwan.\n\nDeng Li noted\u00e2\u0080\u0082that\u00e2\u0080\u0082Pelosi's visit to Taiwan is a naked political manipulation and a flagrant and serious violation of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It\u00e2\u0080\u0082is\u00e2\u0080\u0082only natural for China to take firm countermeasures without hesitation. In the face of the provocative act by the U.S. in\u00e2\u0080\u0082collusion\u00e2\u0080\u0082with certain people in Taiwan, China is absolutely justified in fighting back. Instead of dissuading the U.S. from acts that incite splitting China, aggravate tensions across the Taiwan Strait, and use Taiwan to contain China, or condemning the U.S. for doing so, the European side has brazenly claimed in its statement that \"there is no change in the respective one China policies, where applicable\". This has\u00e2\u0080\u0082seriously violated the one-China principle and had a severe impact on the political foundation of bilateral relations.\n\nDeng Li stressed that the will of the people is not to be defied. The Taiwan question concerns the national feelings of the Chinese people, and safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity is one of the biggest consensuses of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people. We will strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the utmost sincerity, patience and efforts, but we will also prevent the splitting of the country by all means, at any cost, and with the firmest resolve. No country, no forces and no individual should ever misestimate the firm resolve, strong will and great capability of the Chinese government and people to defend state sovereignty and territorial integrity and to achieve national reunification and rejuvenation!\n\n", "id": "87c6b2e86d1930e8a9a0851c08f00d56"}

With 9 percent of the world's arable land and 6 percent freshwater resources, we need to feed nearly 20 percent of the world's population, and there is no existing model for us to copy. We will, as always, bear China's realities in mind as we address issues, make decisions, and take actions. We will stay patient in advancing the course of history and take steady and incremental steps to sustain progress.\n\nXie Feng said that common prosperity represents the great dream of the Chinese nation, and relates to the daily life of every family. Now the average reliability of power supply in China's countryside reaches 99 percent, and what is behind is the input in electricity infrastructure facilities even in some places where \"costs may not be recouped for 100 years.\" We have the world's largest network of high-speed railways, and in some of China's underdeveloped areas, areas inhabited by ethnic minority groups, and revolutionary bases with limited transportation access, we have kept more than 80 \"slow trains\" - still in operation today as public services - on a routine basis, renowned by the people living there as trains for going to market, school and a better life. These trains will continue to usher the people towards a happier life.\n\nXie Feng said that we have established the world's biggest education, social security, and medical health systems, and the average life expectancy has increased to 78.2 years. In the past, 400 million people did not have adequate food, while today 1.4 billion people have high-quality and healthy food. We have solved the historical issue of \"who feeds China\". We have actively developed a whole-process people's democracy. The most prominent feature of whole-process people's democracy is that it integrates process-oriented democracy with results-oriented democracy, procedural democracy with substantive democracy, direct democracy with indirect democracy, and people's democracy with the will of the state. It is a democracy to the broadest extent, of the truest nature, and to the greatest effect possible. Smears by some people in the world of China's institution and practice being \"authoritarianism\" is completely groundless. If the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government were so-called \"autocratic\", how could they get long-term support from more than 90 percent of the Chinese people?\n\nXie Feng said that we adhere to sustainable development, and we protect the Nature and preserve the environment like we protect our eyes. Over the past 10 years, the Chinese people have made great efforts and sacrifices for improving the ecological environment and made remarkable contributions to the global cause of the ecological environment, protecting the environment even if our economic growth has slowed down. China will spend only 30 years achieving carbon emission peak and carbon neutrality which takes most developed countries 50 to 70 years, and China will realize the endeavor with the shortest time in global history. This fully demonstrates a solemn pledge made by a responsible major country to the international community.\n\nXie Feng said that China is the only country in the world that has pledged to \"keep to a path of peaceful development\" in its Constitution, the only one among the five Nuclear-Weapon States that has pledged no first use of nuclear weapons, and the largest troop contributor to peacekeeping operations among the five permanent members of the Security Council and the second largest contributor to UN peacekeeping assessments. China surpasses most countries in the number of neighboring countries, the length of the land border, and the complexity of the border situation. We adhere to settling disputes through dialogue and negotiation, and pursue a defensive national defense policy. However strong it may grow, China will never seek hegemony or expansion. China's development strengthens the world's forces for peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "88bed1bad0113e1cac2bcf50d7078455"}

The two sides had a cordial and friendly exchange of views on China-Sri Lanka relations and international and regional issues of common concern.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that in recent days, Mr. Ambassador frequently participated in activities and gave interviews to the media, actively promoted exchanges and cooperation between China and Sri Lanka in various fields, publicly refuted the so-called \"China's debt trap\" claim, and safeguarded and promoted China-Sri Lanka relations and the traditional friendship. I appreciate this. As traditional friendly neighbors, China and Sri Lanka always promote the strategic cooperative partnership in the spirit of the Rubber-Rice Pact. China supports the efforts of the Sri Lankan government and various sectors to consolidate political stability for the long-term interests of the country, and create favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties, improving people's well-being and reviving the economy. China will continue to provide assistance within its capacity for the Sri Lankan government and people.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that what lies behind Sri Lanka's current economic and financial crisis are not only structural problems of its economy and unexpected factors such as the pandemic, but also adverse spillover effects brought by the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy. As the US media pointed out, a strong US dollar is hurting all countries except the US. According to the International Monetary Fund's estimates, about 60 percent of low-income countries are at high risk of or already in debt distress, compared with 20 percent a decade ago. A strong US dollar harms low-income countries in three aspects: First, it increases financial pressure. Countries have to bear a heavier burden of foreign debts denominated in US dollars and rising costs of importing food, medicine and fuel, which will eventually lead to the depletion of foreign exchange reserves. Second, it encourages capital flight. When currencies depreciate against the US dollar, investors will begin to withdraw their capital and hide their money in safer places, thus further worsening countries' financial problems. Third, it affects economic growth. Enterprises cannot afford the costs of imports that are needed for their operations, and even if demand remains strong, they cannot sell enough products, thus affecting economic output.\n\nLiu Jinsong stressed that Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, in disregard of China's stern warnings, insisted on visiting China's Taiwan region recently. This is a gross violation of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and has a severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations. It gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and seriously violates international law and the basic norms governing international relations. It has aroused strong indignation among the 1.4 billion-plus Chinese people, and China has every reason to respond with resolute countermeasures. China appreciates Sri Lanka's firm support for the one-China principle. China and Sri Lanka will continue to firmly support each other on issues concerning respective core interests, and jointly uphold the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, which is a \"golden rule\" of international relations and the essential safeguard for developing countries to maintain security and independence.\n\nKohona introduced Sri Lanka's efforts to restore social order, expressed gratitude for China's invaluable support during Sri Lanka's trying times, and said that Sri Lanka is keenly aware of the fact that only by realizing development can it truly get out of difficulties. Sri Lanka attaches great importance to China's status and influence as a global super-large market and a major source of overseas investment, and looks forward to deepening mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries in trade, investment, finance, tourism, education, people's well-being and other fields, so as to help Sri Lanka tide over the difficulties and resume development.\n\nKohona stressed that Sri Lanka always adheres to the one-China principle and opposes acts that interfere in other countries' internal affairs. Currently, some countries politicize and weaponize human rights issues to exert pressure on other countries. Sri Lanka is ready to work with China to strengthen high-level strategic coordination in bilateral and multilateral fields, safeguard legitimate rights and interests of the two countries and the vast developing countries, and promote greater democracy in international relations.\n\n", "id": "8b4ebb1bccc530548613ab6adf6dc1b5"}

{"date": "2022-09-24", "title": "Stay True to the Original Aspiration and Carry Forward the Friendship for a Shared Future", "content": "- Speech by Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Liu Jinsong at the Opening Ceremony of the Non-governmental Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations between China and Japan\n\nOn September 24, 2022, Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Liu Jinsong attended and addressed the opening ceremony of the non-governmental commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan upon invitation. His speech went as follows:\n\n\n\nI am delighted to attend the opening ceremony of the non-governmental commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan on behalf of Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Jianghao. In a few days, we will mark the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. At this important juncture, it is both opportune and of far-reaching significance for us to jointly take stock of the course of friendly exchanges between China and Japan, review historical experience and inspirations, and look ahead to the future of bilateral relations. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to the Executive Committee in China for the Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations between China and Japan, the China Public Diplomacy Association and other organizers, and express my respect and gratitude to all the friends who have supported, promoted and participated in the cause of China-Japan friendship.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping said that China and Japan are each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important neighbors separated only by a narrow strip of water, with peace and friendship being the defining feature of bilateral relations in the hearts of the two peoples.\n\nThe millennium-year-long history of mutual learning and friendly exchanges between the two peoples and the strong bond of cultural ties between the two countries have provided a solid foundation and a source of strength for China-Japan relations, leaving behind many touching tales. On this occasion, I would like to share some stories of friendship between the two countries that impress me most.\n\nThe first story is about Zen master Yinyuan Longqi (Ingen Ryuki in Japanese), who traveled east to Japan and sowed the seeds of friendship between the two peoples. In the last years of the Ming Dynasty, Chinese Zen master Yinyuan Longqi was invited to Japan to promote Buddhism. The Obaku school of Zen that he founded became one of the three major Zen sects in Japan, with millions of worshipers. Moreover, he brought to Japan advanced culture and science and technology, known locally as \"Obaku culture\", which had an important impact on the economic and social development of Japan during the Edo Period. The spirit of \"moral support and mutual learning between the East and the West\" upheld by Zen master Yinyuan Longqi has been passed on from generation to generation. It is still of exemplary significance for the friendly exchanges between China and Japan.\n\nThe second story is about the profound friendship between Lu Xun and his teacher Fujino Genkuro, which is an embodiment of \"friendship knows no borders\". In his article \"Mr. Fujino\", Mr. Lu Xun recalled how he made acquaintance and a friend of his Japanese teacher Fujino Genkuro. This article has been included in the Chinese textbook for middle schools in China and has influenced several generations of Chinese people. After parting with Mr. Fujino, Mr. Lu Xun missed him a lot, and said with profound affection that \"Of all those I consider as my teachers, he is the one to whom I feel most grateful and who gave me the most encouragement\". In October 1936, when the news of Lu Xun's death reached Japan, it is said that Mr. Fujino held the newspaper carrying Lu Xun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photo above his head, and bowed several times to pay homage. In sorrow and grief, Mr. Fujino wrote a short and touching essay titled \"Remembering Mr. Zhou Shuren\"(Lu Xun is the pen name of Zhou Shuren).\n\nThe third story is about the Japanese Matsuyama Ballet Troupe overcoming difficulties and unswervingly promoting cultural exchanges between China and Japan. In 1958, the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe adapted the Chinese opera \"The White-Haired Girl\" into a ballet and staged it in China, causing a sensation. For more than half a century, the troupe has visited China to give performances for nearly 20 times, winning wide acclaim and writing a chapter of \"ballet diplomacy\" in the history of friendly exchanges between China and Japan. Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and other Chinese Party and state leaders cordially met with members of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe many times. The founders of the troupe Shimizu Masao and Matsuyama Mikiko also won the cultural exchange contribution awards conferred by the Chinese government in 2004.\n\nThe fourth story is about the mutual assistance between the two peoples in overcoming difficulties in recent years, and joint effort to foster friendship in the new era. We will never forget the touching stories of the two peoples helping each other during the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 and the devastating earthquake in Japan on March 11, 2011. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the two peoples have joined hands to fight the pandemic, writing a chapter of mutual help and support, as described by the poetic lines like, \"Though on different lands, we share the same sky\"; \"Mountains cannot keep us apart, we weather the storm together\". During the Winter Olympic Games Beijing 2022, the Chinese mascot Bing Dwen Dwen was out of stock in Japan because of its rising popularity, and the Japanese figure skater Hanyu Yuzuru set off a wave of \"Hanyu fever\" in China. All these attest to the vitality and enthusiasm of the friendship between the people of the two countries.\n\nFifty years ago, with great political wisdom and strategic vision, the elder generation of leaders of the two countries made the important political decision to normalize the diplomatic relations between China and Japan, opening a new chapter of bilateral relations. The cause of peace, friendship and cooperation between China and Japan has benefited the two countries and peoples, and made important contributions to Asia and the world at large. It deserves to be cherished and we should make unremitting efforts in this regard.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has said that the China-Japan friendship is rooted among the people, and the future of China-Japan relations lies in the hands of the two peoples. Standing at the new starting point of the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations, we hope friends from all walks of life in our two countries will renew the original aspiration of our two countries for peace and friendship, carry forward the tradition of friendship between our peoples, and conduct extensive exchanges and cooperation, including those among young people, so as to deepen and consolidate the foundation of China-Japan friendship. I am confident that with our joint efforts, China-Japan relations will make sustained progress, brim with renewed vigor and vitality, and embrace even brighter prospects for development.\n\n\n\n* * * * *\n\nPresident of the China Public Diplomacy Association Wu Hailong, former Chinese Ambassador to Japan Cheng Yonghua, Japanese Ambassador to China Tarumi Hideo and Chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China Ikezoe Yoichi attended and addressed the opening ceremony. The guests said in their speeches that over the 50 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations, exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields have made great progress, bringing tangible benefits to the two countries and peoples. They look forward to the two sides taking the opportunity of commemorating the 50th anniversary to stick to economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, continuously enhance mutual understanding and friendly feelings between the two peoples, and push for greater development of China-Japan relations in the next 50 years.\n\nThis non-governmental commemoration was themed \"Working in Concert for a Shared Future\". Through cultural exchange exhibitions, photo exhibitions, youth interaction, corporate promotion, interactive live streaming and other means, it showcased the achievements in people-to-people and cultural exchanges and economic and trade cooperation between China and Japan over the 50 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations.\n\n\n\n", "id": "8fbcd816530d368f8373fbab622d0dac"}

The two sides exchanged in-depth views on China-Cuba relations and international and regional issues of common concern.\n\nXie Feng said that Cuba is the first country in the western hemisphere to establish diplomatic relations with New China and has been taking the lead in developing relations with China in the Latin American region. China and Cuba are faithful friends with unbreakable ties, and tested friends devoted to each other and as close as brothers. Over the past 60 plus years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, in the face of the evolving international landscape, China and Cuba have forged ahead hand in hand on the path of building socialism with their own characteristics, supported each other on issues concerning respective core interests, and collaborated closely on international and regional issues, setting a good example of sincerity and mutual support between developing countries and solidarity and cooperation between socialist countries.\n\nXie Feng said that President Xi Jinping had twice conversations with President Miguel Diaz-Canel last year, charting the course for the relations between the two parties and between the two countries. China always views and develops the special friendly relations between the two parties and the two countries from a strategic and overall perspective, and always places China-Cuba relations as spexcial in its overall diplomacy. China is unswervingly committed to deepening the friendship that devotes to each other, to carrying out mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation, and to being a partner for reform and development. The Chinese side highly appreciates Cuba's firm support for China on issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Xizang and human rights, among others, and will, as always, support Cuba in its just struggle to safeguard sovereignty and against interference. For the next stage, the two sides should follow the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, deepen political mutual trust, advance practical cooperation, strengthen multilateral coordination, and constantly consolidate and develop the special friendly relations between China and Cuba.\n\nXie Feng briefed the Cuban side on the great significance of the upcoming 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and elaborated on the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI). He said that China is ready to work with Cuba to step up exchanges of experience in party governance and state administration, jointly promote global development, safeguard world peace and tranquility, advance the socialist cause together, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\n\n\nRodr\u00c3\u00adguez thanked the Chinese side for extending condolences and providing emergency humanitarian assistance to Cuba right after the explosions at an oil storage facility in Cuba recently. He stressed that Cuba and China are good friends, good comrades and good brothers, with the two parties and two countries enjoying special friendly relations. He sincerely wishes othe 20th National Congress of the CPC a successful convening. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez said that under the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, Cuba and China have continuously deepened political mutual trust and maintained close collaboration on international and multilateral occasions over the past years. Cuba always prioritizes Cuba-China relations in its foreign relations, and stands ready to work with China to follow the course charted by the top leaders of the two parties and two countries, further strengthen high-level exchanges, join hands to advance the Belt and Road cooperation, jointly promote the implementation of the GDI and the GSI, unswervingly deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields, and constantly push for new progress in Cuba-China relations.\n\nRodr\u00c3\u00adguez reiterated that Cuba firmly supports the one-China principle, unconditionally supports China on the Taiwan question, strongly condemns any acts that attempt to undermine China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and firmly opposes interference by external forces.\n\nXie Feng stressed that non-interference in internal affairs is a \"golden rule\" that must be abided by in state-to-state exchanges and the essential safeguards for the very survival of developing countries. China's firm countermeasures are a legitimate, necessary, and legal response to Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. They are aimed at stopping the United States' attempt to use Taiwan to contain China, shattering the Taiwan authorities' illusion to pursue Taiwan independence by soliciting the support of the United States, and safeguarding China's core interests. By so doing, China is also upholding the principles of international law, the basic norms governing international relations and the international order, maintaining regional peace and stability, and safeguarding the common interests of developing countries.\n\n", "id": "923bc12d380b364c9ad0563a13aee971"}

Song Yong-sam.\n\nSong Yong-sam said that Pohang Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as POSCO) started its cooperation with China in the 1980s, and set up a representative office in Beijing in 1991. While mainly engaging in the steel industry, it is actively expanding business in such fields as rechargeable batteries and hydrogen energy. Song Yong-sam said POSCO has full confidence in the prospect of China's economic development and is ready to continue expanding investment cooperation in China.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that POSCO, a steelmaker well-known in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and beyond, has grown stronger and bigger through its close cooperation with Chinese businesses. At the same time, it has created jobs in China and contributed to the country's tax revenue. He noted that the steel industry, the centerpiece of POSCO business, provides not only the skeleton of traditional industries, but also the backbone of modern industries. The Chinese side has noted POSCO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vigorous efforts to modernize and diversify its business, and the good economic and social benefits its leading projects have generated such as the HBIS-POSCO Automotive Steel Sheets and the Lithium-ion Battery Electric New Energy Materials Project in Tongxiang City, Zhejiang Province. After the outbreak of COVID-19, POSCO has maintained production and operation in China despite COVID-related difficulties. China applauds POSCO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment, and will continue to provide services and convenience to POSCO and other foreign businesses investing and doing business in China.\n\nLiu pointed out that currently there are multiple favorable factors for businesses from Asian countries to engage in cooperation with China. The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China made a series of important political, theoretical and practical achievements, laying out major policies and strategic plans for advancing the development of the cause of the Party and the country on the new journey in the new era. The Central Economic Work Conference held at the end of last year made an in-depth analysis of the domestic and international economic situations, and set out systematic plans for this year's economic work. The annual Two Sessions will be held in March. These important meetings and policy statements coming out of them show to the world the high degree of stability and continuity of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major principles and policies. China is considering hosting the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation this year. The Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference and the China-ASEAN Expo will also be held this year. These major events will provide important platforms for deepening exchanges and cooperation between China and other countries. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership has come into force and the second-phase negotiations on the China-ROK free trade agreement are being advanced at a faster pace. These will also bring new opportunities for the ROK and other relevant countries to strengthen economic and trade cooperation.\n\nLiu Jinsong stressed that joined by close economic ties and highly integrated industrial and supply chains, China and the ROK have long forged a close-knit cooperation pattern with interconnected interests. The latest report of the Korea International Trade Association shows that as China's economy picks up in the second quarter of this year, the ROK's real gross domestic product (GDP) will increase by an additional 0.16 percentage points, equivalent to one-tenth of the country's estimated growth rate of 1.6-1.7 percent for this year. The ROK's exports will increase by a further 0.55 percentage points, equivalent to 31 percent of the country's export growth last year. China hopes that all parties will respect market rules and principles of free trade, uphold the spirit of mutual benefit and win-win results, and work jointly to promote industrial and investment cooperation that features digitization, low-carbon development and intelligence technology and that adapts to local conditions. Joint efforts should be made to keep industrial and supply chains stable and unimpeded in the region and across the globe to achieve development and prosperity together.\n\nSong Yong-sam said that the stability and continuity of China's economic and trade policies as well as other major principles and policies will bring huge benefits to other countries in the world. As a multinational, POSCO is keenly aware of the importance of keeping global industrial and supply chains stable and unimpeded, and is ready to continue playing a positive role in strengthening ROK-China economic and trade cooperation and enhancing friendship between the two peoples.\n\n", "id": "93671bc90bc0331980ec67c20228629f"}

{"date": "2022-11-02", "title": "China's New Journey Creates New Opportunities for the World", "content": "On November 2, 2022, Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng attended upon invitation the \"Global Insight into Enterprises Directly under the Central Government\" event and delivered a keynote speech, sharing with foreign diplomatic envoys to China his perceptions and thoughts on studying the guiding principles of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Ambassadors and senior diplomats of 60 plus countries to China, Chairman Zhu Hexin and President Xi Guohua of CITIC Group, and responsible officials of relevant departments of the Foreign Ministry, among others, were present.\n\nXie Feng said that the 20th CPC National Congress is of great importance. It takes place at a critical time as the country embarks on a new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects and advance toward the Second Centenary Goal. The first plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee elected a new central leadership with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core. That fully reflects the broad consensus and common will of the entire Party and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, which is based on adapting the basic tenets of Marxism to China's specific realities and fine traditional Chinese culture, has opened a new frontier in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of the times. We will fully implement and adhere to the Thought over the long term. Xie Feng expressed the confidence that with General Secretary Xi Jinping at the helm and under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, China will seize opportunities to realize the development strategies and goals set by the 20th CPC National Congress against all risks and challenges.\n\nFocusing his speech on the major achievements and far-reaching significance of the 20th CPC National Congress, Xie Feng stressed three points. First, \"a meeting characterized by upholding socialism with Chinese characteristics, charting the course for China's development, and forging ahead in unity\". The Congress has charted the course and established the guide to action for the cause of the Party and the country on the new journey in the new era and for realizing the Second Centenary Goal. Second, \"a pioneering and innovative Chinese path to modernization\". Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Chinese modernization is rooted in China with a global outlook. It contains elements that are common to the modernization processes of all countries, but it is more characterized by features that are unique to the Chinese context. Third, \"a strategic choice committed to building a human community with a shared future\". China will make concerted efforts with the rest of the international community to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world featuring lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity.\n\nXie Feng said that China will remain committed to its fundamental national policy of opening to the outside world, pursue a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up, remain firm in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace, work for building a new type of international relations, play an active part in the reform and development of the global governance system, champion the common values of humanity of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, and contribute Chinese insight, input, and strength to building a human community with a shared future. At the same time, we have taken a clear-cut stance against hegemonism and power politics in all their forms, and we have never wavered in our opposition to unilateralism, protectionism, and bullying of any kind.\n\nXie Feng said that China's new journey will create new opportunities for the world with new advances in China's development. China is ready to deepen cooperation with other countries for mutual benefit and an even brighter future!\n\nXie Feng expressed that the enterprisses directly under the central government play a major role in leading China's opening-up and participating in international cooperation, embody an important link between China and the rest of the world. He expressed the hope that today's event will provide a window for the diplomatic envoys to have a deeper understanding of these enterprises, and build a bridge for the two sides to meet their needs and carry out cooperation.\n\nThe diplomatic envoys to China at the event once again extended warm congratulations on the success of the 20th CPC National Congress and President Xi Jinping's re-election as General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, which they believe are of great significance for both China and the larger world. The diplomatic envoys said that they have closely followed the 20th CPC National Congress, and that through today's exchanges, they gained a deeper understanding of the missions, purposes, guiding ideology, governing philosophy and central tasks of the CPC, the characteristics, path and prospects of Chinese modernization, the building of a human community with a shared future and so on. They said that they will report the relevant contents to their respective governments.\n\nThe diplomatic envoys hailed the tremendous changes in China, especially the remarkable accomplishment over the past 10 years. They held the view that the CPC has demonstrated effective leadership. The five characteristics of Chinese modernization, especially those related to poverty alleviation, common prosperity and ecological conservation and whole-process people's democracy, stroke a strong chord among the diplomatic envoys. Some ambassadors recalled that in the 1980s and 1990s, they had traveled in China by \"slow trains\" - still in operation today as public services - mentioned in Xie Feng's speech. They saw with their own eyes how the poor and backward small villages in China \"came out of the tunnel and embraced the light\" through development.\n\nThe diplomatic envoys said that China is a major country with global influence. Noting that the 20th CPC National Congress stressed China will firmly follow the path of peaceful development, firmly pursue a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up, and implement the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, the diplomatic envoys expressed the confidence that China will play a bigger role in promoting world economic growth, addressing global challenges, and safeguarding regional and world peace and stability. They expressed readiness to work with China to strengthen economic and trade cooperation, experience-sharing, and dialogue between civilizations. They also expressed the hope that Chinese enterprises, including thrse direcly under the central government, will be further \"going global\" and expanding cooperation in outbound investment to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results.\n\nVice Foreign Minister Xie Feng also answered questions from the diplomatic envoys on how China handles the relationship between development and security and more.\n\n", "id": "955fdf4e6eb73e2597219f61e93f868c"}

Driven by the Cold War mentality, the United States has been obsessed with \"major-power strategic competition\", to seek absolute strategic advantage, strengthen its military alliance, stoke bloc antagonism and confrontation on the east and west sides of Eurasia and advance the forward deployment of nuclear missile and other strategic forces. These negative measures seriously undermine mutual trust among major countries, make strategies less balanced and less stable, create obstacles to the current international nuclear disarmament efforts, and increase the risk of nuclear arms race and conflict. The international community should take the 10th Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT as an opportunity to practice true multilateralism, firmly resist the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation, uphold the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, have in-depth discussions on effective ways to advance the international nuclear disarmament process, and strengthen the authority and effectiveness of the NPT.\n\nLi Song said that the United States and Russia with the largest nuclear arsenals should earnestly fulfill their special and primary historical responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, and further conduct significant and substantive reduction in their respective nuclear arsenals in a verifiable, irreversible and legally binding manner, so as to create conditions for the eventual realization of comprehensive and complete nuclear disarmament. The United States should give up the development and deployment of a global missile defense system, not seek to deploy ground-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific and Europe, abolish the nuclear umbrella and nuclear sharing policy, and withdraw all nuclear weapons deployed abroad to its own country. The international community should jointly oppose the replication of NATO's \"nuclear sharing\" arrangement by relevant countries in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nLi Song stressed that China is firmly committed to the path of peaceful development and unswervingly pursues a national defense policy that is defensive in nature. It keeps to the stance that \"we will not fight unless we are attacked, but we will surely fight back if we are attacked\". China will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely thwart external interference and separatist attempts for \"Taiwan independence\".\n\nLi Song said, the purpose of China's development of nuclear weapons is to deter enemies from using nuclear weapons against China and to strike back resolutely against them in the event of a nuclear attack on China. Since the first day of possession of nuclear weapons, China has actively stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. China has clearly pledged not to use nuclear weapons first at any time or under any circumstances, and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states and nuclear-weapon-free zones unconditionally. China always keeps its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for national security, does not compete with any other country in the input, size or scale of nuclear force, and never engages in any form of arms race.\n\n\n\n", "id": "9dcd5c587d74398fb9ee3b4a02b74213"}

Deterioration of Economic Polarization in the United States\n\nII. Multiple Factors Driving U.S. Economic Polarization\n\nIII. Serious Negative Implications for American Society\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nBeing the largest economy in the world, the United States is also the most economically polarized among Western countries. It has long been stuck in the conundrum where the rich get richer and the poor become poorer. Since the onset of COVID-19, the United States has adopted massive fiscal and financial stimulus measures. However, these measures fail to address the fundamental difficulties facing the have-nots, but rather offer billionaires a chance to expand their wealth. Economic inequality has become even more prominent.\n\nThrough facts and figures, this report aims to reveal the current state of wealth disparity in the United States, the entrenched political and social causes behind it, and the implications of the problem.\n\nI. Deterioration of Economic Polarization in the United States\n\nSince the 1970s, income inequality and wealth disparity in the United States have continually deepened. The rich keep getting richer, the poor keep getting poorer, and the middle class is squeezed. Today, these perilous trends continue.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The Gini coefficient, which measures inequality in income distribution, has kept rising in the United States. According to the World Bank, the U.S. Gini coefficient has gone up from 0.353 in 1974 to 0.415 in 2019, exceeding the alarming level at 0.4 indicating a large income gap. During the same period, other developed countries have largely kept their Gini coefficient below 0.35, or even 0.3 in some cases.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In the United States, the wealthy population have enjoyed much faster income growth than the low-income group. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, between 1970 and 2020, the average income of the top fifth of families increased by 182 percent to 253,000 U.S. dollars, while the middle-income households and the bottom fifth saw their average incomes grow by just 133 percent to 72,000 dollars and 113 percent to 15,000 dollars respectively. In 1975, the average income of the top fifth was 10.3 times that of the bottom fifth. The gap widened to 17.4 times by 2020.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The share of national income held by upper-income households has risen markedly. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the income shares of the top fifth and top 5 percent have both been climbing. Standing at 43.3 percent and 16.6 percent respectively in 1970, their shares rose to 52.2 percent and 23.0 percent in 2020. In the meantime, the shares held by middle- and low-income households have both declined. The share of the middle-income group dropped from 52.7 percent in 1970 to 44.7 percent in 2020, and that of the low-income group in the bottom fifth fell from 4.1 percent to 3 percent. Since 1993, the income share of middle-income families, who make up 60 percent of total households, has remained lower than that of the top fifth, and is becoming increasingly disproportionate.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The income share of the ultra-rich has reached its highest level since World War II. According to the World Wealth and Income Database, after an initial fall in the early 20th century, the income share of the ultra-rich, or the top 1 percent, in the United States had kept rising, and hit 22.3 percent in 1928. After World War II, a prevailing call for equal opportunity and economic equality, along with the introduction of economic systems such as progressive tax, inheritance tax, strong trade unions and financial regulation, helped restrain the concentration of wealth. By 1970, the income share of the top 1 percent had fallen to 10.7 percent. But it has since risen gradually, and reached 19.1 percent by 2021, almost doubled in 50 years.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 A main cause for the widening income disparity is the huge pay gap. According to Equilar, the median income of CEOs of listed companies in 2021 was 20 million dollars, up 31 percent from 2020, while that of average employees increased from around 69,000 dollars to some 72,000 dollars, up about 4 percent. According to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, CEO pay had skyrocketed by 1,322 percent between 1978 and 2020, while typical worker compensation had risen just 18 percent.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The economic divide is also reflected in wealth inequality. According to Federal Reserve statistics, the richest 1 percent of U.S. households hold more than 20 percent of national household wealth, a share that has continued to grow sharply in recent years. According to Fed statistics in 2021, the top 1 percent held a record 32.3 percent of the country's wealth, up from only 23.6 percent in 1989, while the bottom 50 percent (about 63 million households) held only 2.6 percent, down from 3.7 percent in 1989.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The middle class is shrinking. A \"middle-class America\" was formed in some 20 years from the end of World War II to 1970. Afterward, however, despite the continued growth of the U.S. economy, the middle class has not expanded, but shrunk significantly. The share of American adults who live in middle-income households fell from 61 percent in 1971 to 51 percent in 2019. The share in the upper-income tier rose from 14 percent to 20 percent over the same period. Meanwhile, the share in the lower-income tier increased from 25 percent to 29 percent. The size of middle-income families has continued to shrink.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Social stratification is severely rigid. According to a paper by Raj Chetty and other American economists, the percentage of Americans earning more than their parents fell from more than 90 percent in the 1940s to about 50 percent in the 1980s, with the largest declines for families in the middle class. The opportunities for young people to increase their incomes are fading. Most of the decline is driven by the more unequal distribution of wealth rather than the slowdown in aggregate growth rates. Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, believes that high inequality in American society has resulted in a low level of inter-generational mobility and formed a \"Great Gatsby Curve\" where one's economic standing is more dependent on the wealth of the parents.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The poverty issue in the United States has never been effectively addressed. The overall poverty rate in the country dropped by more than 10 percentage points from 1959 to 1969, but has lingered around 12.5 percent ever since. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 46.2 million American people were living in poverty in 2010, and the poverty rate reached up to 15.1 percent, the highest in 52 years. In 2020, the poverty rate climbed by 0.9 percentage points to 11.4 percent from 10.5 percent in 2019. Currently, 37 million American people are still living below the poverty line.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified economic inequality in the United States. The economic recession triggered by the pandemic has led to massive job losses and further deterioration in the economic situation of low-income earners. At the same time, excessive money supply and large-scale fiscal spending drove up stock and housing prices, bringing enormous benefits to wealthier asset owners. According to a Fed report on household wealth, the total wealth of the richest 1 percent reached a record 45.9 trillion dollars at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, and their fortunes increased by more than 12 trillion dollars, or more than a third, during the course of the pandemic.\n\nII. Multiple Factors Driving U.S. Economic Polarization\n\nThe polarization between the rich and the poor in the United States is caused by multiple factors, including monopoly, electoral politics, government policies, weakened labor unions, and racial discrimination.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Polarization and unequal distribution of wealth are a chronic malaise and an inevitable result of capitalism, giving rise to both wealth accumulation and poverty in the United States. Since the 1970s, conservatism and liberalism have thrived in the country, and marketization and internationalization have been prioritized over equality. The shift in the U.S. economic system toward promoting privatization, repealing progressive taxation, weakening labor unions and loosening financial regulation has made addressing wealth inequality even more hopeless.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement epitomized the American people's grievances about unfair capital accumulation and the disparity of wealth. The core message of the movement was to oppose embezzlement and corruption in the financial sector, economic inequality and social injustice. Slogans such as \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer\" reflected people's profound frustration with the ever-widening wealth gap in the United States. The movement was portrayed by Wall Street as a \"mob\", and dispersed violently by the U.S. government. But 12 years on, the economic disparity is only getting worse.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Partisan conflict and government alternation have led to flip-flops in U.S. policies. Tax policy plays an important role in narrowing the wealth gap. But the rivalry between Democrats and Republicans on taxation has resulted in a failure to effectively tax the rich who have tried every possible means to \"legally\" avoid taxes. According to a report by the news outlet ProPublica, the true tax rate of the richest Americans is only 3.4 percent, far lower than that of ordinary wage earners.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The weakening of trade unions has aggravated such polarization. In the 1950s, about a third of American workers belonged to unions, and the union membership rate was 23.8 percent in 1978. But the number fell to 11.3 percent in 2011 and further to 10.3 percent in 2021. Since Black workers are more likely than workers of other races to be unionized, the decline in unionization has particularly affected them and exacerbated poverty among the Black community.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The wealth gap is closely related to race. Black, Hispanic or Latino households in the United States earn about half the average income of white households, and own only 15 percent to 20 percent of the latter's net wealth. The divide has widened significantly over the past few decades according to Fed statistics. Since 1989, the median wealth of white households has tripled, while the wealth of Black, Hispanic and Latino households has barely increased. According to a Fed survey in 2019, the median white household has a net worth 10 times that of the median Black household, and the 400 richest American billionaires have more total wealth than all 10 million Black households combined.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Racial discrimination is entrenched in the job market. The unemployment rate of Black workers has long been about twice that of whites. Before the outbreak of COVID-19, the unemployment rate in the United States hit a record low of 3.5 percent, but the number was far higher for Black and Hispanic workers. Black professionals are poorly represented in high-paying corporate jobs. In 2020, there were only four Black CEOs among Fortune 500 companies.\n\nIII. Serious Negative Implications for American Society\n\nThe widening wealth gap is one of the main causes for the deepening social crisis in the United States. Problems including growing ethnic conflicts, increasing homelessness, urban riots and violent crimes are all closely related to it.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Social unrest is intensifying. Due to the widening polarization between the rich and the poor, the United States has witnessed frequent demonstrations in recent years. From the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 to the Black Lives Matter protests against police violence in the United States in 2020, some demonstrations have even turned violent. Through these large-scale demonstrations, the underprivileged American people have tried to combat racial discrimination, rigid class stratification and economic polarization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, although the multiple rounds of economic stimulus policies and vast subsidies rolled out by the U.S. government temporarily eased social tensions, such measures have made the debt crisis more entrenched and inflation pressure more difficult to deal with.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The human rights situation is worrying. The wealth inequality has further worsened the human rights situation in the United States. First, average life expectancy has declined. According to the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, the average life expectancy in the country has dropped 2.7 years from 2019 to 2021, with 3.1 years shorter for men and 2.3 years shorter for women. Second, access to higher education is disproportionately skewed toward the rich, while the low-income group has no equal access to education. As a result, public dissatisfaction with higher education is increasing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 82 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds from high-income families participated in college, compared with just 45 percent of those from low-income families. Third, the homeless are living in a dire situation. The growing wealth disparity, especially extreme poverty, is the main reason for homelessness. A report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development showed that more than 580,000 people were homeless in 2020, with 226,000 sleeping outside, in cars or in abandoned buildings.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the poor the hardest. After collecting data from more than 3,200 counties in the United States, and comparing the poorest 10 percent of the counties with the richest 10 percent, the Poor People's Campaign found that the poorer counties reported coronavirus death rates nearly double those in the wealthier ones. Within the 300 counties with the highest death rates, 45 percent of the population live below the poverty line. Galax County, Virginia, had the highest death rate, which reached 1,134 deaths per 100,000 people during the pandemic. With 538 deaths per 100,000 people during the pandemic, Bronx, New York, was also among the 10 percent of counties with the highest coronavirus mortality rates. More than half of the borough's population, 56 percent of them Hispanic and 29 percent Black, live below the poverty line. The fact that COVID-19 took a heavy toll on poorer communities has further highlighted the systemic failure of the United States to address poverty.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 COVID-associated orphanhood has aggravated the poverty problem. More than 200,000 children in the United States have been orphaned by the pandemic. One in every 12 orphans under the age of 18 has lost a guardian due to COVID-19. More than twice as many Hispanic and Latino children in American public schools have lost their guardians as white children. Most COVID-19 orphans have been living at the bottom of the social ladder since they were born. Losing their parents in the pandemic has made their lives even more hopeless. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the US federal government has handed out trillions of dollars in bailouts, but no legislation or executive order has been rolled out to provide help to these COVID-19 orphans.\n\nConclusion\n\nEnding poverty in all its forms everywhere is an important sustainable development goal of the United Nations. Development is fundamentally for the common prosperity of the people, which should become a consensus and common action of all countries.\n\nIn the United States, the world's number one capitalist country, polarization between the rich and the poor is crying out for attention. The yawning wealth gap has become a chronic malaise of American society, leaving an indelible stain on the country's democracy and human rights record. The United States should face up to the grim reality of the ever-widening wealth gap at home, reach out to the people at the bottom, and take earnest measures to solve the problem.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\n", "id": "a4493fbe111b33d7b60964553359632b"}

More than 100 people, including Permanent Secretary of the Foreign Ministry of Myanmar U Chan Aye, Deputy Secretary-General of ASEAN Ekkaphab Phanthavong, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to ASEAN Deng Xijun, Permanent Representative of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar to ASEAN U Aung Myo Myint, responsible persons of Chinese hosts, permanent representatives of ASEAN countries to ASEAN, and representatives of diplomats, Chinese and foreign media and social media attended the ceremony. The ceremony was broadcast live on Facebook, Twitter, Douyin, Sina, Xuexi Qiangguo and other Chinese and foreign new media platforms, with a combined 13 million views online.\n\nWu Jianghao said, China and ASEAN countries, linked by mountains and rivers and enjoying cultural affinity, are natural cooperation partners and close friendly neighbors. Since the establishment of dialogue relations in 1991, China-ASEAN relations have achieved leapfrog development, and pragmatic cooperation in various fields has yielded fruitful results, benefiting 2 billion people in 11 countries of both sides and vigorously promoting regional peace, stability and prosperity.\n\nWu Jianghao pointed out, the Short Video Contest, which provides a brand-new perspective and platform for understanding China-ASEAN friendly cooperation, has attracted broad participation by people from all over the world, especially young friends. Tens of thousands of entries fully demonstrate the richness and vitality of China-ASEAN relations, and also reflect the great enthusiasm of the people of both sides to dedicate themselves to China-ASEAN friendly cooperation.\n\nWu Jianghao stressed, in November last year, President Xi Jinping and leaders of ASEAN countries jointly announced the elevation of bilateral relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, marking a new milestone in the history of China-ASEAN relations. President Xi Jinping's proposal to build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together has received positive responses from ASEAN countries. It is a beautiful vision of the 2 billion people in China and ASEAN to build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together, which calls for further pooling wisdom of all walks of life on\u00e2\u0080\u0082both sides, stimulating the innovation vitality of the general public, and pooling powerful strengths of people-to-people ties.\n\nWu Jianghao put forward three suggestions: First, strengthen the pattern of great exchanges. Before the pandemic, up to 60 million visits were made annually between China and ASEAN. Large-scale and all-round personnel exchanges are an important advantage of China-ASEAN relations. It is important to strengthen planning and preparation, resume personnel exchanges as soon as possible after the pandemic is under control, and promote closer interaction and exchanges in various fields such as culture, tourism, think tanks, media, women and sports, as well as at sub-national levels. Second, focus on promoting mutual understanding and affinity among young people. As the future and hope of China-ASEAN lie in young people, we need to pay more attention to enhancing the exchanges and understanding among Generation Z, and inherit and carry forward the traditional friendship between China and ASEAN. China will actively support the Year of ASEAN Youth this year, implement leading projects such as the Young Leaders Scholarship, and encourage more outstanding young people of ASEAN to study in China. Third, strive for greater inclusiveness and more mutual learning. The culture and customs of China and ASEAN, similar and colorful, are our common valuable treasure. We should uphold the diversity of our civilizations, derive inspiration from the collision of diverse civilizations, and enhance friendship by seeking inclusive co-existence, thus adding new vitality and impetus to the development of China-ASEAN relations.\n\nWu Jianghao hopes that the Short Video Contest will become increasingly stronger and bigger, further expand its coverage and influence, and do a good job in recording, telling and spreading the friendship stories between China and ASEAN. He expects that the contestants will present more truthful, multi-dimensional, colorful and vivid works, inspire and encourage more ordinary people in China and ASEAN, and jointly contribute strengths to building a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful and amicable home together.\n\n\n\nThe guests attending the ceremony spoke highly of the Short Video Contest. They hold that cultural and people-to-people exchanges are a \"stabilizer\" and \"lubricant\" for ASEAN-China relations. The Short Video Contest provides a platform for people of both sides, especially young people, to tell the story of China-ASEAN friendship by using digital technology. That's in line with the needs of the digital age. They believe that the contest will further enhance mutual understanding between the people of both sides, promote people-to-people ties between China and ASEAN, and contribute to building a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future.\n\nThe Third ASEAN-China \"Friendship and Cooperation\" Short Video Contest was co-hosted by the Mission of the People's Republic of China to ASEAN, the National Radio and Television Administration of China, the Permanent Mission of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar to ASEAN, the China International Communications Group, the ASEAN Secretariat, the Department of Asian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, the China Public Diplomacy Association, and the People's Government of Wuxi Municipality. The first contest was held in 2020. The first and second contests received a total of more than 51,000 entries from China and ASEAN countries. The entries have recorded a combined 320 million views on Chinese and foreign social media platforms, of which 20 million views went to award-winning works.\n\n", "id": "b452ac948663380fa30248daafa3d415"}

The fact is crystal-clear and allows for no misrepresentation or smearing. However, the United States, turning a blind eye to the fact, has obstinately used force against the civilian airship that is leaving the US airspace, in an apparent act of overreaction and a serious violation of the spirit of international law and international practice. What the US has done has severely impacted and undermined the efforts and progress the two sides have made in stabilizing China-US relations since the Bali summit. The Chinese side hereby expresses its firm objection to and strong protest over this, and urges the United States not to take any further actions that may undermine China's interests or escalate or expand tensions. The Chinese government is closely following the developments of the situation, will resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese company concerned and firmly defend China's interests and dignity, and reserves the right to make further responses if necessary.\n\n", "id": "b49d0a55ff783daf80285aa0e98dbc87"}

The Report to the 20th CPC National Congress emphasized that the CPC has dedicated itself to achieving lasting greatness for the Chinese nation and committed itself to the noble cause of peace and development for humanity.

Director-General of the Department of Arms Control of the Foreign Ministry Sun Xiaobo attended the event upon invitation, and expounded on the position of the Chinese government on Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water of Fukushima into the ocean. Secretary-General of China Arms Control and Disarmament Association Li Chijiang and Chief Expert of the Nuclear and Radiation Safety Center of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment Liu Xinhua attended upon invitation the briefing. Journalists from more than 20 mainstream media outlets of the United States, Russia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, France, India, Pakistan and Iran, as well as journalists from such domestic media outlets as China Media Group, China Global Television Network and the Global Times attended the event.\n\nSun Xiaobo said that on April 13, 2021, Japan unilaterally decided to dispose of the water contaminated by the Fukushima nuclear accident and discharge it into the ocean. China expressed serious concern and resolute opposition to this. The Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water contains a large number of radionuclides, and many radionuclides have no effective treatment technology, which will cause unpredictable harm to the marine environment and human health. The 30-year discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean will have a cross-border impact and bear on the global marine environment and public health. Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to discharge the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean is to transfer the risks to all humanity. China, the Republic of Korea, Russia, the Democratic People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of Korea, and Pacific island states have repeatedly expressed their concerns, but Japan has not engaged in full and meaningful consultations with stakeholders, nor has it provided adequate scientific and credible explanations on the legitimacy of the discharge plan of the nuclear-contaminated water, reliability of data, effectiveness of purification devices and uncertainty of environmental impact.\n\n\n\nSun Xiaobo pointed out that the Task Force of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has not yet completed the assessment of Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ocean discharge plan, and has not reached a final conclusion. Instead, it has pointed out a series of inconsistencies between Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ocean discharge plan and the IAEA Safety Standards. Nevertheless, Japan still forced the approval of the implementation of the specific plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean in July last year, and announced on the eve of the inspection and assessment of the IAEA Task Force in Japan on January 16 this year that it would start discharging the water into the ocean in spring and summer this year. This is by no means what a responsible country should do.\n\nSun Xiaobo emphasized that Japan should dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water in a safe manner consistent with the obligations of international law, international safety standards and international good practices from an objective and scientific perspective, including fully studying and examining other disposal plans other than discharging the water into the ocean. Japan must not start discharging nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean before all stakeholders and relevant international agencies can confirm the safety of the ocean discharge plan.\n\n\n\nLi Chijiang and Liu Xinhua respectively elaborated on the hazards of the ocean discharge plan of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water from legal, scientific and professional perspectives, and pointed out that Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean violates international obligations stipulated in general international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nSun Xiaobo and the two experts also took questions from the journalists.\n\n\n\n", "id": "b4d3e60b528e3234928074ea794b6f40"}
{"date": "2022-09-02", "title": "Implement UNCLOS in Full and in Good Faith and\u00e2\u0080\u0082Actively Contribute to Global Maritime Governance", "content": "\n\nYour Excellency State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi,Your Excellency Under-Secretary-General Miguel de Serpa Soares,Distinguished guests,\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to join you in this conference to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the opening for signature of UNCLOS. Just now, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi offered important views and proposed pioneering initiatives on upholding the principles and spirit of UNCLOS and advancing global maritime governance. The opinions shared by Under-Secretary-General Soares in his address also give us much food for thought.\n\nThe UNCLOS negotiations were the first major international legislative process China took part in after the restoration of its lawful seat at the United Nations. China was one of the first countries that signed UNCLOS in December 1982, and ratified the Convention in 1996, giving a strong boost to its conclusion and entry-into-force. As a State Party to UNCLOS, China has fully and faithfully implemented UNCLOS, and proved itself an active participant, builder and contributor to the Convention and its mechanisms.\n\nFirst, China has constructed a matrix of maritime legislation to facilitate UNCLOS implementation on the ground. In accordance with the provisions and spirit of UNCLOS, China has promulgated the Law on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone and the Law on the Exclusive Economic Zone and the Continental Shelf. China has also introduced the Marine Environment Protection Law, the Fisheries Law, the Sea Areas Administration Law and other important maritime laws for the purpose of strengthening the protection of the marine environment and preservation of marine resources. In recent years, by promulgating the Law on the Deep Seafloor Exploration, introducing the Coast Guard Law, and revising the Maritime Traffic Safety Law, China has further strengthened its maritime legislation system consistent with UNCLOS and other international law.\n\nSecond, China has ensured standard operation of marine scientific research and worked together with other developing countries to advance human knowledge of the ocean. China has continued to strengthen management of marine scientific research in accordance with UNCLOS, and actively engaged in cooperation on marine scientific research. China has built joint maritime research centers with the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan and Tanzania, among others, and assisted Nigeria, Mozambique, Seychelles and Madagascar in conducting scientific research on the continental shelf. Through the participation in the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030), China has contributed its share to advance the learning and protection of the ocean.\n\nThird, China has worked to protect humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blue homeland and followed a sustainable approach to fisheries development. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Ecological Civilization, China has stepped up its participation in the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities of the United Nations Environment Programme to promote clean and beautiful oceans across the globe. China has joined regional fisheries management organizations including in the North Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, and committed itself to sustainable development of fisheries on the high seas and a zero-tolerance approach to illegal fishing. China is actively studying the accession to the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing.\n\nFourth, China has supported the capacity building of the three UNCLOS bodies to facilitate the efficient functioning of the Convention. China has by now acquired five prospecting and exploration mining areas from the International Seabed Authority (ISA) and contributed two reserved areas on its part. Together with the ISA, China has built the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first joint training and research center on deep seas. China has firmly upheld Annex I Article 5 of the rules of procedure of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), and submitted to the Commission preliminary information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in the East China Sea. Meanwhile, China has contributed its wisdom and strength to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) with the submission of written statements on relevant advisory opinions. As the largest funding contributor of the ISA and the ITLOS, China has always paid its membership contributions on time and in full, providing strong financial support to the functioning of the two institutional bodies.\n\nChina has all along maintained that maritime disputes shall be handled through negotiation and consultation by the parties directly concerned. China does not accept or recognize the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009caward\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the South China Sea arbitration, which is for the very purpose of upholding the authority and integrity of UNCLOS.\n\nFifth, China has protected the freedom and safety of navigation and ensured smooth international shipping. China respects and supports the freedoms of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all countries in its surrounding sea areas under international law. China actively implements UNCLOS and the relevant provisions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and has acceded to almost all conventions under the IMO framework. China has steadily boosted maritime rescue and other services, and significantly improved the conditions for navigation safety. China has been deeply involved in work related to the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia, and has actively carried out naval escorts in the Gulf of Aden. Over the years, China has worked proactively to ensure and protect the navigation rights of all countries in different sea areas, and there has never been a problem with navigation in the sea areas within its jurisdiction.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nAs President Xi Jinping pointed out, the blue planet humans inhabit is not divided into islands by the oceans, but connected by the oceans to form a community with a shared future. At present, global transformation unseen in a century is evolving at an accelerated pace, and new global maritime issues keep emerging. We must accurately interpret and apply UNCLOS in its entirety and in good faith, and give balanced consideration to UNCLOS, other maritime treaties and general international law. We should bear in mind the Convention\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original goal of upholding the interests of mankind as a whole, oppose the distortion and abuse of UNCLOS, reject the practice of double standards and selective application, and discard the mindset of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmight is right\u00e2\u0080\u009d. We should strengthen international cooperation, balance marine environmental protection and utilization, safeguard global food and energy security, attach higher importance to new forms of ocean utilization including seawater desalination and tidal energy, and take credible steps to raise developing countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to learn about, utilize and protect the sea and participate in global maritime governance.\n\nWe need to faithfully uphold the purposes and principles of UNCLOS. UNCLOS gives due regard for the sovereignty of all States and aims to promote the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans and realize a just and equitable international economic order. UNCLOS has established important principles including peaceful uses of the seas, freedom of the high seas and the international seabed as the common heritage of mankind. All parties should follow the purposes and principles of UNCLOS, duly exercise their rights under the Convention, fulfill their obligations under the Convention in good faith, reject the law of the jungle at sea, and oppose the attempt to threaten other country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sovereignty and security by using the sea.\n\nWe need to strictly abide by the regime on navigation stipulated in UNCLOS. UNCLOS has stipulated the regime on navigation for various sea areas including the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and high seas. Foreign ships enjoy innocent passage in the territorial sea, but such passage shall not be prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State. They enjoy freedom of navigation in the exclusive economic zone, but shall have due regard to the coastal State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sovereign rights over natural resources and jurisdiction over marine scientific research and environmental protection, among others. All parties enjoy freedom of navigation in the high seas, but must comply with such requirements as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe high seas shall be reserved for peaceful purposes\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In exercising navigation rights in different sea areas, all parties should fully abide by the provisions of UNCLOS in letter and spirit; otherwise the integrity and authority of UNCLOS will be undermined. Even if one is not a State Party to UNCLOS, it should not underscore only their navigation rights while ignoring the legitimate rights and interests of coastal States. The attempts to misinterpret the regime on sea areas established by UNCLOS and play up the so-called freedom of navigation issues are driven purely by ill intentions. China respects the lawful navigation rights of all countries, but firmly opposes certain country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move to threaten China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sovereignty and security in the name of freedom of navigation.\n\nWe need to accurately apply the dispute settlement mechanism of UNCLOS in good faith. UNCLOS advocates \u00e2\u0080\u009cto settle, in a spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation, all issues relating to the law of the sea\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The parties to a dispute are the owners of the dispute settlement procedures. Only when the procedures are approved and accepted by the parties concerned, can they be truly effective in settling the dispute. All parties concerned and international institutions should honor the principle of State consent, act in line with the realities of the dispute among regional countries, and accurately apply the dispute settlement procedures in good faith, and must not overstep or abuse their mandate.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nStanding at a new historical starting point and faced with new circumstances and challenges, China is ready to work with all parties to uphold the purposes and principles of UNCLOS, fully and accurately implement the provisions of UNCLOS, meet the challenges of the era, steadily improve global maritime governance rules, and build a maritime community with a shared future.\n\nTo conclude, I wish this conference a full success. Thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "b4eecf28d84331b8a81146d160d33732"}

The Surge of Gun Violence in the United States\n\nII. Gun Control: An Uphill Battle in the United States\n\nIII. Gun Violence Lays Bare the Decline of U.S. Governance Capacity\n\nConclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\nGun violence is a chronic disease in the United States. With its interplay with gun culture, individual rights, interest groups and partisan politics, it has long plagued American society and gravely violated people's right to life, leaving an indelible stain on the country's human rights record.\n\nThrough facts and figures, this report sheds light on the alarming state of gun violence in the United States and the political and social causes of this entrenched problem.\n\nI.The Surge of Gun Violence in the United States\n\nGun violence is one of the acutest social problems in the United States, with ramifications not only for the victims and their families, but also for the entire society and country. In addition to the casualties caused and the threat to public security, it has also resulted in enormous economic losses and social trauma for the nation.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The United States is the country with the most civilian-held firearms. With less than 5 percent of the world's population, it accounts for 46 percent of global civilian gun ownership.\u00e2\u0080\u0082As estimated by the Small Arms Survey in Switzerland, the global stockpile of civilian-held firearms has increased from 650 million in 2006 to 857 million in 2017, largely attributable to soaring figures in the United States. In 2017, about 393.3 million guns were privately owned in the United States at a time when its population was less than 326.5 million.\u00e2\u0080\u0082This amounts to 120.5 firearms for every 100 people.\u00e2\u0080\u0082The second-ranked country was war-torn Yemen, with 52.8 guns per 100 people. While the United States ranks first in the world in terms of both individual gun ownership and the number of guns per capita, only about 1.07 million civilian guns are registered,\u00e2\u0080\u0082indicating that the vast majority of firearms owned by civilians are left unregistered and uncounted.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086A latest study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) reveals that the United States is in the midst of a massive gun-buying boom that shows no signs of abating. From 2000 to 2020, annual production of firearms in the country almost tripled,\u00e2\u0080\u0082with a dramatic increase in the\u00e2\u0080\u0082past three years\u00e2\u0080\u0082in particular. Since 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about more social problems. The \"Black Lives Matter (BLM)\"\u00e2\u0080\u0082movement sparked a series of looting and riots, aggravating social insecurity. As a result, demand for semi-automatic pistols for self-protection surged and gun sales soared at a record pace. According to the U.S. National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the United States conducted 21 million background checks for gun purchases in 2020, a 60 percent increase from 2019 and a record high, surpassing the previous record in 2016 by 5.3 million. The sudden first-time gun ownership by millions of Americans has inevitably given rise to considerable security threats.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Individual ownership of a large number of guns has triggered incessant violence, putting social security in the United States at greater risk. As pointed out by some American scholars, gun-related deaths in the United States in one week may exceed those in the whole Western Europe in one year. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the firearm homicide rate in the United States reached its highest level since 1994. According to a survey by the Giffords Law Center, 32 of the country's 50 largest cities witnessed a prominent increase in firearm homicides in 2021. The Guardian reported in October 2021 that every 16 hours, a woman is fatally shot by her partner in the United States. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from 2018 to 2021, the proliferation of guns not only resulted in a spike in homicides across the country, but also led to more suicides by people with mental illnesses. According to the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), gun-related casualties surged to 85,584 in 2021 from 34,231 in 2014.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Among the nearly 95,000 homicides between 2015 and 2019, about 74 percent were committed with firearms. In 2020, firearm-related deaths reached 45,222, an average of 124 per day. Firearm injuries are one of the top five causes of death for people aged 1 to 44 in the country.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Recent years have witnessed frequent mass shootings in the United States, causing alarmingly high casualties. By American standards, a mass shooting is defined as an incident of gun violence in which four or more people are injured or killed, excluding the suspect or the gunman. According to GVA data, both mass shootings and deaths in the United States have surged about fourfold since 2013. There were 417 mass shootings in the country in 2019, 611 in 2020, and 692 in 2021.\u00e2\u0080\u0082In 2022, there were 213 mass shootings reported in 34 states and the capital Washington, D.C. by the end of May, with 242 killed and 912 wounded, a 50 percent increase over the same period in 2017 and a 150 percent increase over the same period in 2013. On July 4, 2022, Independence Day of the United States, a 21-year-old white man fired more than 50 shots from a rooftop at a parade in Highland Park, a suburb north of Chicago, killing at least seven people and injuring more than 30. On Jan. 21 and 23, 2023, tragic shootings occurred in Monterey Park of Los Angeles County, California and Half Moon Bay in northern California, killing 17 and injuring 11.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The United States has seen repeated mass school shootings for many years, causing serious trauma to the American society. The mass shooting at the Columbine High School in Colorado in April 1999 killed 13 people and left more than 20 injured.\u00e2\u0080\u0082In April 2007, the shooting at Virginia Tech resulted in the death of 32 students and faculty members. GVA data show that, over the past decade, 27 mass school shootings took place in the United States. The deadliest shootings among them are:\u00e2\u0080\u0082December 2012, Connecticut, Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, 26 killed including 20 children aged six to seven; October 2015, Roseburg, Oregon, Umpqua Community College shooting, 10 killed; February 2018, Parkland, Florida, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, 17 killed (14 students and 3 faculty members) and 17 injured;\u00e2\u0080\u0082May 2018, Houston, Santa Fe High School shooting, 10 killed. In May 2022, an 18-year-old gunman entered the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and killed 21 people including 19 children.\u00e2\u0080\u0082This last incident was the 27th school shooting in the United States in 2022. It was also one of the worst in recent years.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Gun violence also inflicts huge economic losses. According to Brady, an organization that advocates gun control, gun violence costs the U.S. economy at least 229 billion U.S. dollars each year. In May 2022, in the wake of the shooting at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde County, Texas, over 200 CEOs co-signed a letter urging the U.S. Senate to take immediate actions to address gun violence. In the letter, it was stated that \"gun violence costs American taxpayers, employers and communities a staggering 280 billion U.S. dollars per year\".\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Gun violence has also taken a toll on the everyday life of the American people. A poll conducted by the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 21 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0082of American adults have experienced gun violence in which their relatives, friends or themselves have been threatened with a gun or have fallen victim to a shooting. As many as 54 percent\u00e2\u0080\u0082of black and hispanic Americans say that they have had similar experience. The Associated Press reported a survey by the American Psychological Association (APA), which shows that one-third\u00e2\u0080\u0082of American adults feel they cannot go anywhere without worrying about being a victim of a mass shooting, and nearly a quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0082of them admit that they have changed their behavior due to fear of mass shootings.\n\nII.Gun Control: An Uphill Battle in the United States\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, U.S. state and local governments have made various attempts to introduce legislation on gun control, but such efforts all ended up either long in words but short on action, or flip-flopped. No real progress was made on gun control.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The second amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides for the right of individuals to keep and bear arms. In recent years, as gun-related issues have become increasingly prominent, pro-gun and pro-control advocates have engaged in heated debates on the interpretation of the second amendment. Organizations that support gun rights claim that individual rights should not be arbitrarily modified and gun control is illegal. Organizations that support gun control argue that the second amendment establishes a collective right, rather than an individual right to possess guns, and the government has the right to control guns. Such debates have resulted in stalled efforts on gun control legislation, and Supreme Court rulings based on the second amendment are often not in favor of gun control.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In the United States, there is significant disparity in gun control from state to state, and relevant legislation efforts at the federal level are often slow, inconsistent and contradictory.\u00e2\u0080\u0082In 1927, an act passed by Congress banned mail shipment of firearms such as pistols and revolvers to individuals, but did not prohibit the delivery of such firearms through private delivery firms. Under this act, individuals are allowed to buy guns across state lines. In 1968, the Gun Control Act passed by Congress did not include registration and licensing requirements for all firearms and their carriers, nor did it ban the import of firearm components. In 1969, the lobbying power of the U.S. National Rifle Association (NRA) propelled Congress to waive requirement for registration of buyers' information by sellers of shotgun and rifle cartridges. In 1986, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act signed by President Ronald Reagan made it easier for unlicensed individuals to sell firearms. It also allowed firearms to be sold at gun shows, and banned the establishment of any comprehensive system of firearm registration.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which protects firearm manufacturers from civil liability for crimes committed with their products. Pro-gun groups have also used legislation and federal courts to resist gun control efforts. In June 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller. With this ruling, the District of Columbia lifted the ban on handguns and allowed individuals to keep guns at home. Justice Antonin Scalia, who presided over the case, noted that the second amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear firearms, and that the District of Columbia's ban on handgun possession in the home violated that right. The Supreme Court's ruling and its opinion on this case have directly affected gun control legislation across the United States. In 2012, in the wake of a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school, Senators Joe Manchin and Patrick Toomey drafted a compromise bill to expand background checks on gun buyers. The bill fell short of the 60 votes\u00e2\u0080\u0082required to move forward and was thus defeated. In the ensuing decade, all congressional efforts to pass bills to enhance background checks on gun buyers ended up in failure.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In March 2021, the House passed the \"Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021\", which requires background checks on all gun sales. In May 2022,\u00e2\u0080\u0082two mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas sparked hundreds of anti-gun violence demonstrations, and calls for gun control re-surged. The Senate and the House adopted new gun control legislation, only after Democrats significantly weakened the control measures. At the same time, however, the Supreme Court issued a ruling striking down New York State's 1911\u00e2\u0080\u0082law which restricts carrying a concealed firearm in public. This directly undermined the ability of state and local governments to monitor firearms in New York, California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey, among others.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Due to the difficulty of Congress to act on gun control, the U.S. administration could only regulate certain types of firearms and firearm modifications through presidential executive orders. In June 2022, Congress passed a gun-related bill called the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. According to a Pew poll, most people are not optimistic about the bill's effect in reducing gun violence in the United States. Seventy-eight percent think it will do little, of which 36 percent think it will do nothing at all.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The American public is deeply divided on gun control. Public opinion polls in recent years have shown that women, urban residents, non-native borns, liberal-leaning people and non-gun owners are more likely to support gun control, while men, rural residents, native-born Americans, political conservatives, hunters and gun owners oppose it. The gap between Americans' stance on gun control is still widening.\n\nIII.Gun Violence Lays Bare the Decline of U.S. Governance Capacity\n\nGiven a political system where different sides hold each other back, an increasingly polarized political ecosystem, pervasive interest groups and ineradicable racial discrimination, gun control in the United States is in stalemate, and a total ban on guns is effectively a mission impossible.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086How the U.S. political system is designed and operates constitutes the root cause of ineffective gun control. Gun control intensity varies across different states, making it increasingly difficult to regulate guns and perform interstate enforcement. Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group, compared gun policies across the country, rating every state on the strength of its gun laws and comparing it with its gun violence occurrence. A positive correlation was found between ineffective gun control and gun violence rate. Eight states, including California and Hawaii,\u00e2\u0080\u0082with comparatively well-established gun laws saw relatively low gun violence rates, while the 13 states with the weakest gun control, including Texas, Alaska and Missouri, have nearly three times as many gun deaths as the eight states mentioned above.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Positions of Democrats and Republicans on gun control are becoming increasingly polarized. In 1968, the House voted 305-118\u00e2\u0080\u0082and the Senate 70-17\u00e2\u0080\u0082to pass the Gun Control Act. Since then, the two parties have been increasingly divergent over gun control. Republicans have always supported gun ownership, while Democrats have unequivocally supported gun control. Given the polarized U.S. political landscape at present, it is even more difficult for either party to compromise. The New York Times reported that since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook, despite a Democratic push for gun control, 14 Republican-controlled states have gone the opposite way, passing laws allowing their citizens to carry guns without any licensing process. The Washington Post reported that in recent years, the Republican Party has posted a myriad of pictures and videos containing guns in newspapers, billboards and social media to appeal to voters who oppose gun control for campaigning purposes.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Interest group lobbying is rampant. Group politics and electoral politics in the United States have provided legalized channels for gun groups to conduct money politics and influence the stance of Congress members on guns. According to OpenSecrets statistics, from 1990 to 2022, gun ownership groups contributed 69.3 million U.S. dollars to federal and state candidates, while gun control groups contributed 51.6 million U.S. dollars. From 1998 to 2022, gun ownership groups spent 190.4 million U.S. dollars on lobbying, while gun control groups spent 28.9 million U.S. dollars. In the 117th Congress, 262 members have been sponsored by the NRA, among which 19 have each received more than 1 million U.S. dollars cumulatively. The vast majority of them are Republicans. Meanwhile, the NRA has spent handsomely against pro-gun control lawmakers. All five of the lawmakers whom the association has paid millions of dollars to oppose are Democrats.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Gun violence is exacerbated by long-standing social problems in the United States such as social inequality and racial tensions. Research shows that blacks are much more likely to encounter gun murder than whites, and half of all gun murder victims are black. In 2010, 14.6 out of 100,000 blacks were murdered, compared with 1.9 for whites.\u00e2\u0080\u0082According to research by the CDC, between 2019 and 2020, gun homicides nationwide rose from 14,392 to 19,350, with the occurrence rate up from 4.6 to 6.1 per 100,000 people, a 34.6 percent increase.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Of the 90,498 gun-related deaths in 2020 and 2021, 38,796 were murders, among which nearly 21,000 involved young black males.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe right to life is the biggest human right. The Declaration of Independence begins with the statement that life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are unalienable rights. One gunshot after another have shattered the American Dream that all men are endowed with the unalienable rights to life and liberty, and lead people to reflect deeply on where the American-style human rights really are. Some U.S. politicians have long treated the American people's right to life with indifference. Faced with growing gun proliferation, they have done nothing more than empty talks and prolonged debates, while pointing fingers at the human rights conditions of other countries. The most important thing that they are duty-bound to do is face up to and address their own problems, and let the American people enjoy true freedom from the fear of gun violence.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\n", "id": "bba0679780a03e58a42f4e5f62169406"}

{"date": "2022-11-02", "title": "Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng: Building a Human Community with a Shared Future is the Right Path for the World", "content": "\n\nOn November 2, 2022, when Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng attended the \"Global Insight into Enterprises Directly under the Central Government\" event, and delivered a keynote speech, sharing with foreign diplomatic envoys to China his perceptions and thoughts on studying the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress, he said that the world, our times and history are changing in ways like never before. The world has once again reached a crossroads in history, and its future course will be decided by the people all over the world. China's choice given at the 20th CPC National Congress is promoting world peace and development and building a human community with a shared future.\n\nXie Feng said that building a human community with a shared future is the right path for the world. General Secretary Xi Jinping solemnly declared that China will advance the building of a world that enjoys lasting peace through dialogue and consultation, a world that enjoys universal security through joint contribution and shared benefits, a world that enjoys common prosperity through win-win cooperation, an open and inclusive world through exchanges and mutual learning, and a clean and beautiful world through green and low-carbon development.\n\nXie Feng said that opening-up is an essential requirement for building a human community with a shared future. China is the staunchest advocate and also a down-to-earth practitioner. Even though some countries close their markets to us and restrict Chinese investment under the pretext of so-called national security, we are still committed to opening up. Over the past 10 years, the number of free trade agreements that China has signed with foreign countries increased from 10 to 19, and the total foreign trade volume increased from 4.4 trillion U.S. dollars to 6.9 trillion U.S. dollars, making China a major trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions. All four sessions of the China International Import Expo have been successful with intended deals worth 270 billion U.S. dollars. 21 pilot free trade zones and the Hainan Free Trade Port have been set up, and the items on the negative list for foreign investment shortened from 190 to 27. Over the past 10 years, the capital stock of China's FDI abroad has soared from less than 0.6 trillion U.S. dollars to over 2.7 trillion U.S. dollars, and China's annual FDI in actual use has hit 1.15 trillion yuan, up from 700 billion yuan. In 2021, up to 48,000 new foreign-invested enterprises were set up in China, nearly double the number in 2012.\n\nOn the eve of the 20th CPC National Congress, relevant departments of China issued Several Policies and Measures on Increasing the Inflow of FDI, Stabilizing the Stock of FDI and Improving the Quality of FDI Utilization with a Focus on Manufacturing, making every effort to address the prominent problems facing foreign-invested enterprises in China. This document has put forward 15 specific measures, such as implementing the post-establishment national treatment for foreign investors at a high standard, facilitating the exchange of international business personnel, enhancing the unimpeded flow of freight logistics, and strengthening financial support for foreign-invested enterprises. China's door will open still wider and China's investment and business environment will only get better. The so-called claim that China will be \"more closed\" and \"backpedal\" couldn't be farther away from facts and is not in our interests.\n\nXie Feng said that opening-up should come both ways and cooperation should be mutually beneficial. Certain countries are keen to create exclusive cliques, stoke decoupling and breakage of industrial and supply chains, build \"a small yard with high fences\", push for \"friend-shoring\", form the Chip 4 Alliance, and conceive an exclusive economic framework. They attempt to gang up to contain and suppress China, which has severely impacted the normal development of the world economy and the security of the global supply chain. Taking China down will only be counterproductive. In 2021, the trade between the United States and China reached a record high of more than 750 billion U.S. dollars, a 28.7 percent increase over the previous year. Tesla opened a showroom in Xinjiang, and Germany's Volkswagen AG announced an investment of 2.4 billion euros in China in October this year. These fully reflect that people from all walks of life, including the business community, have a discerning eye, the law of the market is powerful, and the concept of win-win cooperation is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.\n\nXie Feng said that Belt and Road cooperation is an important platform for practicing building a human community with a shared future. China has signed over 200 Belt and Road cooperation documents with over 170 countries and international organizations. Thanks to the Belt and Road Initiative, East Africa and Cambodia have their expressways, the China-Laos Railway, the cross-sea bridge in the Maldives and the Peljesac Bridge in Croatia have been completed and opened to traffic, and steady progress has been made in the construction of the Hungary-Serbia Railway, the China-Thailand Railway and other projects. The Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Railway is Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway, with a designed top speed of 350 kilometers per hour. With more than 90 percent of the civil works completed at present, it is expected to be put into commercial operation in June of next year. By the end of last year, overseas economic and trade cooperation parks built by Chinese companies in partner countries have created more than 340,000 jobs for local people. To build a human community with a shared future, China has put forward the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, which have received positive responses from the international community. Going forward, we are ready to continue to work together with the international community to achieve more tangible results.\n\n\n\n", "id": "bfea87ceac233514ab308085e150aa2a"}

In the aftermath of the earthquake, China has provided the largest amount of and most substantial assistance and is also one of the most responsive countries. At the next stage, China stands ready to work with Afghanistan, to well implement the consensus reached at the high-level meeting between the two countries and the third Foreign Ministers' Meeting on the Afghan Issue Among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan. We will not only help Afghanistan cope with short-term natural disasters and humanitarian difficulties, but also support Afghanistan in enhancing its capacity for disaster prevention and mitigation and economic self-reliance in the medium and long term, so as to provide assistance within our capacity for Afghanistan to improve people's livelihood and achieve more sustainable development.\n\nZakir Jalaly\u00e2\u0080\u0082thanked China for its sympathy as well as timely and massive humanitarian assistance, saying that the telephone conversation between Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and State Councilor Wang Yi yesterday was very constructive and strengthened the confidence of the Afghan people in disaster-hit areas. China, a friend of Afghanistan in times of difficulties, has always been steadfast in providing political, economic and humanitarian support to the Afghan people at their most difficult times\u00e2\u0080\u0082and helping the Afghan interim government tide over difficulties.

Drug Abuse: A Social Malaise in the United States\n\nII. Enormous Social Cost of Drug Abuse in the United States\n\nIII. Multiple Causes of Drug Abuse in the United States\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe challenge arisen from the use of drugs is an international one; it is most acute in the United States. Twelve percent of global drug users come from the country, three times the proportion of the U.S. population to that of the world. Based on facts and statistics, this report examines the gravity, causes and economic and social costs of drug abuse in the United States.\n\nI. Drug Abuse: A Social Malaise in the United States\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The U.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0082National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics (NCDAS) lists eight categories of drugs most commonly used in the country: alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, fentanyl, opioids (mainly referring to psychotropic substances under control), prescription stimulants, methamphetamine and heroin. Forty-six percent of U.S. drug users report having experience using cannabis and prescription stimulants, 36 percent opioids and methamphetamine, 31 percent prescription stimulants, 15 percent heroin and 10 percent cocaine.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In 2021, findings by NCDAS show about 19.4 percent of Americans have used illegal substances at least once. Out of the 280 million aged 12 and older, 31.9 million are drug users, with 11.7 percent on illegal substances and 19.4 percent either having consumed illicit drugs or misused prescription drugs\u00e2\u0080\u0082in 2020. If alcohol and tobacco users are included, the number of people in the United States who are abusing substances totals 165 million.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 During the past 12 months, 48.2 million Americans over the age of 18 consumed cannabis at least once. Between 2018 and 2019, use of the substance increased by 15.9 percent. Though outlawed by the federal authorities, cannabis is legal in 15 states for recreational use. The cannabis industry in the country surged despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. When many businesses closed in March 2020 amid the pandemic, cannabis pharmacies in the eight states that legalized the substance were able to maintain their \"essential businesses\" because sales were allowed to continue during the period of mass home quarantine. As a result, legal cannabis sales in the United States hit a record 17.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, a 46 percent jump from that of 2019, according to BDSA, a platform providing cannabis sales data.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 During the past 12 months, 10.1 million Americans have consumed opium at least once. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid is the primary driver of the spike in drug-related deaths. Between April 2020 and April 2021, 75,000 Americans died from opium overuse -- more than 75 percent of the total deaths from drug overdose and a 50 percent rise year on year.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Each year, 95,000 people in the United States die from alcohol abuse. During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 60 percent of Americans increased their consumption of alcohol. According to the latest data, 25.8 percent of those aged 18 and older reported binge drinking in the past month, and on any given day 261 Americans would die from excessive drinking, 80 percent of whom are adults over the age of 35.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Adolescents experience the fastest rise in drug overdose deaths. In this group, the 18 to 25-year-olds are the heaviest drug users, with 39 percent of them using drugs. For the 26 to 29-year-olds, it is 34 percent. Seventy percent of drug users try illicit drugs before the age of 13, and drug users as a population group is becoming younger. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reports that between January 2021 and June 2021, about 1,150 youngsters aged 14 to 18 died from drug overdose, a 20 percent increase from that of 2020 and more than doubling the number in 2019. In addition, 47 percent of adolescents start consuming illicit drugs upon graduation from high school.\n\nII. Enormous Social Cost of Drug Abuse in the United States\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Drug overdose exacts a high death toll on the U.S. population, greatly eroding the base of labor force and weighing on life expectancy. According to a report on the American journal Science, American death toll of drug overdose has increased exponentially over the past 38 years -- up 9 percent almost every year and doubling about every eight years. A record high of 72,000 deaths was registered in 2017. The report also shows drug abuse plagues almost all states in the United States, with only a few exceptions, i.e.\u00e2\u0080\u0082South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa. In the past decade, drug abuse deaths in the country have risen significantly; the numbers\u00e2\u0080\u0082more than tripled\u00e2\u0080\u0082in Delaware and New Hampshire. According to the CDC, in the year following the outbreak of the pandemic (from April 2020 to April 2021), more than 100,000 people in the United States died from drug overdose, eight times that of shooting incidents, and nearly tripling the number of deaths in traffic accidents. Between 1999 and 2017, there were more than 700,000 cumulative deaths from drug overdose in the United States. Drug overdose in the country has claimed more lives than AIDS, traffic accidents and shootings, and 70 percent of the deaths are men between the age of 25 and 54.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Drug abuse engenders frequent social problems. The damage to cranial nerves caused by drug taking may aggravate anxiety and cognitive disorder, induce some mental illnesses, and cause emotion dysregulation, thus leading to problems like family discord, violent crimes, and psychological trauma in children. In addition, people caught using illegal drugs may be punished by being separated from their family and deprived of job opportunities, welfare assistance, public housing and voting rights. As a result, discrimination against drug users continues, and stigmatization will further intensify inter-generational poverty and racial discrimination. This forms a vicious cycle, which is detrimental to American society and becomes an \"American disease\" that cannot be fixed easily. As the protracted COVID-19 pandemic and growing inflation and unemployment exacerbate anxiety and the sense of isolation among people in American society, drug abuse has become increasingly severe, and the number of people addicted to drugs has soared.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Drug control incurs tremendous social cost. Such cost is entailed in crime fighting, health care, productivity loss, drug education and the prevention and treatment of other social problems. Among them, fighting drug-related crimes and health care cost the most. Since 1971, the United States has spent one trillion U.S. dollars combating drug-related crimes, according to a study by the University of Pennsylvania. In 2017, the cost of drug control in the United States exceeded 270 billion U.S. dollars.\n\nIII. Multiple Causes of Drug Abuse in the United States\n\nFor years, the U.S. federal and state governments have vowed to vigorously tackle the drug problem, but have in fact failed to take substantive measures due to lobbying by various interest groups. Drug abuse in the United States is a reflection of deep-rooted social problems, and the result of an interplay of economic interests, lobbying, and social and cultural factors.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 As the U.S. economy expanded after World War II, the rapid growth in national wealth created an unprecedentedly prosperous consumer market, including an active drug trade. By the 1960s, the nationwide hippie movement and the hippie culture it generated were ubiquitous in the United States, a part of which was \"drug culture.\" Under the influence of \"drug culture,\" drugs such as cannabis and heroin quickly became popular among young people. The hippie movement brought drugs to the public, and its promoters claimed that cannabis was harmless and not a narcotic drug. Apart from that, they pushed for the social acceptance of cannabis abuse on the grounds of human rights and liberty, and called for its legalization. After the late 1970s, as the public witnessed the tremendous harm that drug abuse caused to society, families and individuals, there was a convergence in American people's perception of drugs and drug control. By the mid-1980s, calls for drug legalization waned, but there was no substantive improvement in the drug problem in the United States. Since the 1990s, calls for drug legalization have risen again in the country.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The U.S. government has pushed for the legalization of cannabis and other drugs out of economic considerations. Legalizing cannabis allows the government to generate significant tax revenues from the legal drug market, and in return, the distribution of such revenues becomes an important driver of drug legalization. The U.S. government has justified drug legalization to cover the fact that it would do anything for economic gains.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In 2014, cannabis was legalized in Colorado. Since then, the cumulative sales of cannabis have exceeded one billion U.S. dollars. However, the number of deaths from various kinds of drug abuse in the state has reached record highs. According to The New York Times, American parents said it got much easier for teens to obtain cannabis after its legalization in Colorado, potentially seriously endangering their brain development. Some experts said in interviews that they had treated a number of patients with symptoms related to drug addiction including severe vomiting due to cannabis use, including children who intentionally or accidentally consumed cannabis. The legalization of cannabis has further boosted the black market, which in turn puts great pressure on the judicial system and threatens social security. A large number of criminal organizations grow cannabis in Colorado and then smuggle it into other states where it is illegal, making the cannabis trade more active and law enforcement more difficult.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Knowing the serious social problems brought by the legalization of cannabis, the U.S. government has not responded by strengthening cannabis control, but instead further promoted drug legalization. Between its people's lives and health and economic interests, the U.S. government has chosen the latter, which is an important factor in the sustained push for drug legalization in the country. According to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, an American think tank, one could hardly see in the National Drug Control Strategy issued by the U.S. government the important roles the government is supposed to play in fighting one of the biggest public health challenges. Instead, it has sat idle as drug and substance abuse worsens.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 Interest groups in America keep fanning the flame of the drug problem. In order to maintain their profits, large pharmaceutical enterprises in the United States throw a large amount of money into sponsoring experts and associations to peddle the narrative that \"opioids are harmless.\" What they want is to push for drug legalization and prod pharmacies into promoting drug sales and doctors into indiscriminate prescription of drugs. As a result, some patients have unknowingly developed drug addiction that they could not get rid of. After analyzing disclosed data from the U.S. Senate, the OpenSecrets website found that the marijuana and cannabis industry, which involved more than 20 businesses, spent as much as 4.28 million U.S. dollars on lobbying in 2021 alone. In addition, Amazon paid 14.5 million U.S. dollars between April and December in 2021 for funding lobbying activities, including for the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act) which supported the legalization of cannabis. For the same purpose, the American Civil Liberties Union spent 920,000 U.S. dollars on lobbying between July and December in 2021. British American Tobacco and the Altria Group spent nearly 2.1 million and 6.6 million U.S. dollars respectively in 2021 on lobbying for the MORE Act. The House of Representatives actively considered bills that promote the legalization of marijuana and cannabis. \"We don't need to convince people to believe in cannabis. We need to convince them to buy legally,\" said Cory Rothschild, vice president of a U.S. company in the cannabis industry.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The drug culture influences America's drug policies. The U.S. drug culture has been shaped by the country's development history and directly affected the adjustment and evolution of America's drug policies. Due to pressure from both work and life, many people in the United States choose to take drugs for relief or leisure. Against this backdrop, in order to prevent people from using medical treatment as a pretext for drug abuse, U.S. federal law stipulates that one must present prescription by a doctor when purchasing certain drugs. However, this policy has big loopholes in terms of supervision, and drug abuse is prevalent in the United States. Pharmacies could still sell psychotropic drugs at will. As hospital reimbursement is directly linked to patient satisfaction, many doctors are forced to prescribe psychotropic drugs.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The COVID-19 pandemic has made long-existing social problems even worse in the United States, and the pressure caused by such problems as gun violence, racism, social injustice and huge wealth gap is increasingly felt by young people. The various difficulties faced by young Americans are a reflection of America's persistent social illness. On the one hand, the widening gap between the rich and poor in the United States gives young Americans more doubts about the \"American Dream\" as they could hardly see room for upward mobility. On the other hand, young people no longer feel proud of America due to intensifying social inequality, racial conflicts and other problems. A Gallup poll showed that Americans' pride in the United States hit a record low in 2020. Only 36 percent of the respondents aged 18 to 24 said they were proud to be American, while 35 percent did not express pride in being American. In December 2021, the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University published the findings of its survey, which showed that 52 percent of the respondents believed American democracy was \"in trouble\" or \"failing\"; only 7 percent of young Americans viewed the United States as a \"healthy democracy\"; 51 percent of the young respondents had \"felt down, depressed and hopeless\" at least a few times in the past two weeks; 25 percent of the respondents had thoughts of self-harm; and 25 percent of them believed the cause of their mental health problems was economic concerns. As young people's confidence in the United States drops dramatically and the pressure they face keeps growing, more and more of them turn to drugs to relieve their stress.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The drug problem is a manifestation of America's failure in social governance. According to Howard Koh, former Assistant Secretary for Health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, drug and substance abuse in the United States is one of the most devastating public health disasters. Apart from causing heavy burdens on the public health system, it could make millions of people lose their homes or jobs, become truant or face family breakdown. The COVID-19 pandemic masked this crisis, but in the meantime also amplified it. The crisis showcases the U.S. government's failed regulation across multiple systems, and it is imperative to make prompt, unified and comprehensive response.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe drug problem of America is a long-standing and deep-rooted disease that is yet to be cured. The U.S. government has not done enough to raise public awareness of the harm of narcotic drugs; the measures it took to reduce drug demand are ineffective; and its drug control actions produce poor results. The United States should face its own problem squarely, take actions to deal with the domestic issue of prevalent drug abuse, and protect the American people's right to life and health, instead of shying away from the problem.\n\nThe fight against drugs requires, first and foremost, one's own efforts. At the same time, it also needs cooperation among all countries. The United States should stop making unwarranted accusations against China and undermining China-U.S. counter-narcotics cooperation. Even less should it mislead the public and shift its responsibility for ineffective response to drug abuse at home onto others.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\n", "id": "cfa7c14f2c493707b1d8012b63d26dd7"}

They exchanged views on bilateral relations and international and regional issues of common interest.\n\nLiu Jinsong extended a warm welcome to Ambassador Shrestha for his assumption of new office in China. He expressed, China and Nepal have enjoyed a long history of bilateral exchanges and Mount Qomolangma bears witness to the history and height of our friendship. As early as in the 4th century AD, Fa Xian, an ancient Chinese monk, visited Lumbini, a Buddhist pilgrimage site in Nepal. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the friendly cooperation between the two countries has kept pace with the times under the personal promotion of successive leaders of the two countries. No matter how the situation at home and abroad changes, China and Nepal have always adhered to mutual respect and equality, firmly adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and firmly supported each other on issues concerning each other's core interests. In March this year, I visited Nepal for the first time as part of a delegation. I felt the beauty, richness and nature of Nepal and the simplicity, kindness and diligence of the Nepali people. I also felt the profound social foundation of China-Nepal relations. Going forward, China is ready to work with Nepal to implement the outcomes of President Xi Jinping's historic visit to Nepal in 2019, and jointly advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, so as to promote the in-depth development of China-Nepal relations.\n\nAmbassador Shrestha said, Nepal and China are friendly neighbors linked by mountains and rivers. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 67 years ago, bilateral relations have witnessed flourishing development and stability and peace along our border. Nepal firmly pursues the one-China policy and supports China's position on core interests related to Taiwan, Xizang and Xinjiang. Nepal admires China's remarkable achievements in development and wishes the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) a complete success. Nepal is willing to work with China to implement the outcomes of President Xi Jinping's historic visit to Nepal and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation. Nepal hopes that China will overcome the impact of the pandemic and continue to facilitate customs clearance of Nepali goods at border ports.\n\nLiu Jinsong pointed out that the cross-border railway project between China and Nepal is an important consensus reached by the heads of state and also a project of the century for China-Nepal connectivity. The Chinese pop song \"Sky Way\" says: \"It is really a miraculous sky way, bringing warmth to the remote land... Bringing us to the paradise. The highland barley wine and butter tea will be sweeter and happy songs are heard everywhere\". It expresses the people's best expectation of railway construction. Just nine months after its opening, the China-Laos Railway has already brought huge profits to China-Laos exchanges and cooperation as well as the economic and social development of the Laos. At present, both passenger transportation and freight transportation are so much thriving that it can be hard to get a ticket. If the China-Nepal cross-border railway can be completed as soon as possible, it will surely boost the mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Nepal, help the economic growth of Nepal and bring sweetness and happiness to the Nepali people. We need to work together with confidence to make solid progress in the construction of the China-Nepal cross-border railway and the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, and help Nepal transform from a land-locked country into a land-linked country.\n\nShrestha said, the construction of the China-Nepal cross-border railway has been the dream of generations of Nepali people and will be a \"Sky Way\" that truly benefits the Nepali people. He thanked the Chinese side for announcing the use of the aid funds to support the feasibility study for the cross-border railway between China and Nepal and for sending experts to Nepal to carry out the survey within this year. Recently, many Nepali people have asked me and the embassy for the latest progress on railway construction, which can be said to be eagerly awaited.\n\nLiu Jinsong said, some Western countries have spread rumors about Xinjiang-related issues, politicized and weaponized human rights issues, grossly interfered in China's internal affairs and provoked bloc confrontation. For a long time, Western countries have ignored their own serious problems in the field of human rights, and have been constantly lecturing, challenging and putting pressure on developing countries, and even pushing for the so-called \"democratic transformation\". As a result, they have caused unrest, conflicts and humanitarian disasters, and become the biggest disaster maker of human rights violations around the world. We oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries in the name of democracy and human rights and oppose double standards on human rights issues. The rights to subsistence and development are the most basic human rights. Through the unremitting efforts of the CPC and the people of the whole country, China has eliminated absolute poverty. Nepal has also made significant achievements in poverty reduction and is on track to graduate from the UN's Least Developed Countries list soon. China and Nepal should firmly safeguard the common interests of developing countries on the human rights issue, strengthen exchanges and mutual learning on human rights, unequivocally promote a correct outlook on human rights in the international arena, and resist attempts to interfere in other countries' internal affairs under the pretext of human rights.\n\nShrestha said, before entering politics, I had been engaged in education and human rights undertakings at the community level in Nepal for a long time. Over the past 30 years, I am fully aware of the broad scope of human rights, covering economic, social, political and other aspects. I highly recognize the importance of the rights to subsistence and development to the human rights cause in developing countries. There is no one-size-fits-all human rights standard or path in the world. Respecting and protecting human rights must be in line with each country's national conditions. Nepal opposes the use of human rights issues to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, and stands ready to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with China and other developing countries in the field of human rights, truly serve the needs of our own people and the expectations of the international community, and promote the sound development of human rights at home and abroad.\n\n\n\n", "id": "d2fed4228db63165b8c9fe9c722ed180"}

This shows that justice has prevailed over. Most member states of the HRC, especially developing countries, have seen through the pernicious attempts of the United States and some other Western countries to \"use Xinjiang to contain China\", and deeply abhor their despicable tricks of using human rights as a pretext to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. Liu said Xinjiang is my hometown and a wonderful place. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang welcome people from all walks of life and from all over the world to visit Xinjiang to experience and appreciate firsthand the real Xinjiang and its development. At the same time, we firmly reject acts of fabricating lies, smearing, political manipulation and double standards by some countries and forces, and oppose using human rights issues as a political tool and weapon. In his statement, the Permanent Representative of Pakistan in Geneva spoke in recognition of China's dialogue and engagement with the UN human rights mechanism, pointed out that the draft decision undermines the spirit of constructive engagement, and voiced support for China's efforts and achievements in human rights protection. China appreciates the Pakistani side's statement and its vote against the draft decision. This once again demonstrates the tradition of \"ironclad\" friendship and mutual support between China and Pakistan. It is also another example of the two sides defending international fairness and justice, upholding the right direction of the HRC and safeguarding the common interests of developing countries.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that the recent worsening debt crisis and inflation spikes in some developing countries are closely linked to the aggressive interest rate hikes and balance sheet reduction by a certain developed country which has caused severe turbulence in the international financial market. To curb domestic inflation and serve its domestic political agenda, it ignores the spillover effect of its monetary policy adjustment, squeezes the monetary policy space of other countries, pushes up the inflation of other countries, and increases the debt burden of emerging economies. This may drag the world economy into stagflation and recession, bringing long-term negative effects on international trade and investment, the smooth operation of the industrial and supply chains, and global financial stability. It is abnormal for a country's currency to make trouble for all other countries. China is ready to work with Pakistan to follow closely some of the critical issues in global economic and financial governance, focus on development agenda, and jointly safeguard development outcomes.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that the 77th session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution of solidarity with and support for Pakistan's response to the floods. China welcomes the resolution and supports Pakistan in seeking more international support through the international community and various multilateral platforms. China will continue to provide assistance to Pakistan through bilateral and multilateral channels, and stands ready to deepen cooperation with Pakistan in post-disaster reconstruction, disaster preparedness and mitigation, pandemic prevention and control and other areas.\n\nNoting the great importance of the upcoming 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Haque wished the Congress a complete success. He thanked the Chinese government and people of all sectors for their strong support for Pakistan's disaster relief and post-disaster reconstruction effort. Pakistan will maintain close strategic coordination with China, consolidate the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership with China, and strengthen exchanges and cooperation and multilateral coordination in various fields between the two sides. Pakistan is firmly committed to the one-China policy, and will continue to firmly support China on issues related to Xinjiang and human rights.\n\n", "id": "d966491ac58f3e1cb5f02a8960295a2c"}

The Africa-China Alliance for Poverty Alleviation will serve as a platform to pool resources to support poverty reduction for agricultural development in Africa, promote the exchange of experience on governance and poverty reduction and development between China and Africa, and advance the sustainable development of poverty reduction in Africa.\n\n\n\nThe 2022 FOCAC Africa-China Poverty Reduction and Development Conference, hosted by the National Rural Revitalization Administration, is an important event to implement the follow-up actions of the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the FOCAC. The Africa-China Poverty Reduction and Development Conference has been held for 12 sessions so far. The theme of this year's conference is \"Deepen the Partnership for Poverty Reduction and Development, Promote High-Quality Development of China-Africa Cooperation\".\n\n", "id": "e02c91132a03337694129969c7551cde"}

It seriously violated the basic norms governing international relations and the principles set out in the four political documents between China and Japan, and sent a seriously wrong signal to the international community, which is extremely egregious in nature, and has seriously adverse impact. China firmly rejects and strongly condemns this.\n\nDeng Li pointed out that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. The Taiwan question is purely an internal affair of China and its historical ins and outs are crystal clear, so are the facts and status quo that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China. In disregard of China's strong opposition, Pelosi visited China's Taiwan region. It is a serious violation of the one-China principle and a serious infringement upon China's sovereignty, which has outraged the Chinese people and triggered widespread opposition from the international community. It is reasonable, lawful, legitimate and justified for the Chinese government to take countermeasures to uphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity and oppose secession. Opposing secession and achieving the reunification of the motherland is the shared will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people. We will strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity, patience and efforts, but we will also prevent the country from splitting by all means, at any cost, and with the strongest determination.\n\nDeng Li stressed that the Taiwan question concerns the political foundation of China-Japan relations and the basic trust between the two countries. Japan, which colonized Taiwan for a long time, bears inescapable and serious historical responsibility for the Taiwan question and should be more cautious in words and deeds. China strongly urges Japan to abide by the principles set out in the four political documents between China and Japan and its political commitments on the Taiwan question, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, prudently and properly handle Taiwan-related issues, and stop going further down the wrong path.\n\n", "id": "e0e1046da8e13641a05080b9046c8449"}

Xie Feng recalled the complete success of the state visit paid by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and Cuban President Miguel D\u00c3\u00adaz-Canel Berm\u00c3\u00badez's to China in November last year, during which the two heads of state jointly charted the course for the development of China-Cuba relations in the new era and agreed to work together to build a China-Cuba community with a shared future. China is ready to work with Cuba to follow through on the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state. The two foreign ministries, being in the lead of carrying forward the China-Cuba friendship and deepening exchanges and cooperation, should do a good job in this regard and make new contributions to the development of bilateral relations.\n\n\n\nThis year marks the beginning of full implementation of the guiding principles laid down at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and a new journey to build China into a modern socialist country in all respects. While both the Two Sessions of China and the 10th National Assembly of People's Power of Cuba are around the corner, China is ready to work with Cuba to increase experience sharing on state governance, jointly promote innovation in socialist theories and progress in the practice, and open a new frontier in adapting Marxism to national contexts and the needs of the times, so as to guide a better development of our respective socialist causes.\n\n\n\nCuban Deputy Foreign Minister Anayansi Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez Camejo delivered a video speech. She said that the Cuba-China relationship is a special and friendly one based on equality, trust, respect and recognition. President D\u00c3\u00adaz-Canel's visit to China last November was of milestone significance, with the two heads of state reaching important common understandings on the development of China-Cuba relations in the next stage. She noted close cooperation between the two foreign ministries and recalled her fruitful political consultations with Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng at the vice foreign ministerial level last August. Cuba appreciates China's support to the country on such issues as the U.S. blockade and the explosions at an oil storage facility, and will insist on its firm opposition on foreign interference in China's internal affairs. At the same time, Cuba will abide by the one-China principle, and work with China to deepen strategic coordination, advance the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, and jointly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the developing countries.\n\n\n\nIn his speech, Ambassador Pereira thanked the Chinese Foreign Ministry for its efforts to coordinate and promote bilateral cooperation over the years. He said that Cuba is ready to work with China to implement the important common understandings reached between the two state leaders, advance various cooperation agendas, continue the deepening of the brotherhood between Cuba and China, and jointly uphold international fairness and justice.\n\n\n\nThe event was permeated with a warm atmosphere. The guests and hosts enjoyed their nice conversations and interactions, and enhanced mutual understanding and friendship.\n\n", "id": "e28df2feb5d635d8af4880d9ba1dec72"}

They also exchanged views on bilateral relations, among other topics.\n\nLiu Jinsong said, the Chinese government improves and re-calibrates COVID response measures in light of the changing situation. At present, the overall pandemic situation in China is taking a favorable turn. In the future, China's economic and social vitality will be further unleashed, exchanges between Chinese and foreign personnel will be more convenient, and the Belt and Road cooperation and other major economic, trade and investment exchanges will show a more robust momentum. All these will bring greater development opportunities to Timor-Leste and other Asian countries.\n\nLiu Jinsong said, China always upholds the philosophy of putting people and life first, conducts more targeted and science-based prevention and control, and shares the genome data of the virus with the World Health Organization in a timely and earnest manner. In fact, the main variant now spreading in China has previously been found elsewhere, and no new variant is found in China. Previous variants such as Delta and Omicron came in from overseas. It is clearly double standards for some countries to make groundless accusations against China's prevention and control policies while ignoring their own problems. In his speech at the UN General Assembly last year, President Jose Ramos-Horta sharply pointed out that developing countries such as Timor-Leste see the contrasting reactions of the Western countries to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other regional conflicts as double standards. It seems that it's difficult for them to quit this old habit and they will repeat the old tricks on different issues. Noting that Timor-Leste is a friendly neighbor of China, Liu Jinsong said that China believes that the government and people of Timor-Leste will understand and support China's pandemic prevention policy and open its door to warmly welcome Chinese tourists. The development of China-Timor-Leste relations is a vivid portrayal of mutual respect and treating each other as equals between big and small countries. China is ready to strengthen high-level exchanges with Timor-Leste, carry out livelihood and capacity-building projects in such major fields as agriculture, education, culture, and oil and gas in light of the country's actual development demands, and support Timor-Leste's modernization drive without reservation. He said that China will encourage more enterprises to invest and do business in Timor-Leste and more friends from Timor-Leste are welcome to China to do business, study, visit or travel. \"The whole year's work depends on a good start in spring.\" There is a saying in both China and Timor-Leste, \"Where there is a will, there is a way.\" China is ready to work with Timor-Leste to seize opportunities and lose no time to continuously deepen practical cooperation in various fields, so as to bring more tangible benefits to the two peoples.\n\nSantos said, what he has seen and heard in China over the past three years as Ambassador to China has made him deeply admire China's pandemic prevention policy. China's improvement and re-calibration of pandemic prevention and control are of great significance to regional and global economic development. Timor-Leste looks forward to expanding personnel exchanges with China and will not take any restrictive measures against Chinese tourists. Timor-Leste firmly believes that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with General Secretary Xi Jinping at the core, the Chinese modernization drive will surely see more brilliant achievements and bring greater development opportunities to neighboring countries, including Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste always adheres to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and respects the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries. Timor-Leste will continue to firmly abide by the one-China principle and this position will not change. Timor-Leste looks forward to continuing close high-level exchanges with China, thanks China for its assistance in the process of agricultural modernization in the country, and stands ready to expand areas of bilateral cooperation and push for more fruitful results in the China-Timor-Leste comprehensive partnership of good-neighborly friendship, mutual trust and mutual benefit.\n\n", "id": "e51af7a567b631f68ea6d118ce3804b0"}

Brazil attaches great importance to developing relations with China, and speaks highly of the important role played by Brazil-China cooperation in Brazil's economic and social development. Brazil is ready to work with China to further explore pragmatic cooperation in various fields, strengthen communication and coordination in multilateral areas, and consolidate and deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries, so as to better benefit the two peoples.\n\n\n\n", "id": "e931be6fcab13ba08b9dec64eadd8be8"}
{"date": "2022-10-14", "title": "Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Liu Jinsong Meets with Bruneian Ambassador to China Pehin Dato Rahmani", "content": "\n\nOn October 13, 2022, Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Liu Jinsong met with Bruneian Ambassador to China Pehin Dato Rahmani. The two sides exchanged views on China-Brunei relations and international and regional issues of common interest and concern.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that the Communist Party of China (CPC) will soon convene its 20th National Congress in Beijing. This congress will set well-conceived goals and tasks for China's development in the next five years and beyond, and will draw an overarching plan for China's future development. Standing at a new historical starting point, China will continue to play the role of a responsible major country, offer more public goods to the world, and work with neighboring countries, including Brunei, to address global risks and challenges, advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, implement the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, and build a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that the friendship between China and Brunei has lasted for over a thousand years, and that the two countries are good friends and neighbors having heart-to-heart affinity despite the distance keeping them apart. The two countries have set a fine example of treating each other as equals and living in harmony between countries regardless of size. Next year marks the fifth anniversary of the China-Brunei strategic cooperative partnership. China is ready to take this opportunity to work with Brunei to step up high-level exchanges, seek greater synergy between strategies, and upgrade bilateral relations. The two sides should ensure sound implementation of key Belt and Road cooperation projects such as the Hengyi PMB Refinery and Petrochemical Project and the Brunei-Guangxi Economic Corridor, and continuously expand cooperation in energy, agriculture, green economy, digital economy and other areas to benefit the two countries and peoples.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that Xinjiang is my hometown and Xinjiang is a nice place. Your Excellency Ambassador visited Xinjiang in August this year and actively shared your first-hand experience and the real situation in Xinjiang. I appreciate this. For some time now, the United States and some other Western countries have been misinforming the public about Xinjiang to smear China's image and contain China's development. They used the so-called Xinjiang-related report to put together a so-called draft decision in the Human Rights Council in an attempt to use UN human rights bodies as a tool to interfere in China's internal affairs. It is clear to all who stand for fairness and justice. Most members of the Human Rights Council, especially developing countries and most Muslim countries, are clearly aware that the ultimate motive of the United States and some other Western countries behind their Xinjiang narrative is to contain China. The draft decision was eventually voted down, a result marking that the United States' move had failed. The issues related to Xinjiang are not about human rights. They are about countering violent terrorism, radicalization and separatism. China hopes that Brunei will continue to firmly support China on Xinjiang-related issues in the future.\n\nRegarding the U.S. administration's new National Security Strategy and a series of moves to advance the Indo-Pacific Strategy, Liu Jinsong pointed out that what the Asian region needs at present is peace, development, free trade, regional cooperation and post-pandemic recovery rather than Cold War mentality, zero-sum game and unilateral sanctions. Certain Western countries are inciting bloc confrontation, provoking arms races, creating closed small circles, and deliberately splitting the global industrial and supply chains. What they do runs counter to the trend of the times and the expectations of regional countries, and is doomed to be unpopular and bound to fail.\n\nRahmani wishes the 20th National Congress of the CPC a complete success, saying that he admires the CPC's achievements in state governance, including poverty reduction and pandemic response. Rahmani said that the friendship between Brunei and China, dating back to ancient times, has maintained the sound momentum of development for many years. Although the weather is getting colder, Brunei-China relations are getting warmer. He sincerely thanked China for providing vaccines in time to Brunei amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He looks forward to the early resumption of exchanges between the two sides in various fields and at all levels. Rahmani also happily recalled his visits to Urumqi, Kashgar, Aksu and other places in Xinjiang. He said that Xinjiang enjoys social stability and harmony among ethnic groups, and that Xinjiang will have a brighter future. Islam advocates peace and rejects terrorism. Brunei always respects other countries' national sovereignty and opposes interference in other countries' internal affairs. Brunei is ready to work with China to address global challenges and safeguard regional peace and stability.\n\n", "id": "e93b9ab7d52f3dcca65f1326f5ca3519"}

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great\u00e2\u0080\u0082honor andpleasure to meet you all in this beautiful\u00e2\u0080\u0082capital\u00e2\u0080\u0082city ofTashkentand participate in the International Conference on Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0082(ICA). First of all, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to thank Uzbekistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts for making this conference possible.\n\nI believe strongly, as you would all do, that the situation in Afghanistan today matters a lot to humanity, and to regional and\u00e2\u0080\u0082global security and stability, in spite of many other changes in the world. If Afghanistan situation deteriorates into chaos, the international community will no doubt be negatively impacted. And that would be a disaster for the region\u00e2\u0080\u0082first and foremost, and no less so to the whole world as well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been nearly one whole year since the Kabul Moment. With joint efforts from the international community and regional countries, stability is gaining ground\u00e2\u0080\u0082in Afghanistan, and there has yet been no major refugee exodus\u00e2\u0080\u0082so far. Meanwhile, it should be noted that the economy and people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s livelihood are facing serious difficulties due to some major power\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unilateral sanctions\u00e2\u0080\u0082and significant drop in external aids. Frequent natural disasters\u00e2\u0080\u0082also added hardship. Now, 72% of the Afghan population live below the poverty line\u00e2\u0080\u0082with 23 million people in\u00e2\u0080\u0082the shortage of food.The unemployment rate has reached 38%. The IS launches terrorist attacks every now and then, and the terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and ETIM are taking advantage of that situation\u00e2\u0080\u0082to accumulate strength. Terrorism and security threats in Afghanistan are far from alleviation. With distraction from the Ukraine issue and the so-called Indo-Pacific Strategy pushed and sold\u00e2\u0080\u0082by the US, external attention and input to assist Afghan people both have declined. It is essentialthat we\u00e2\u0080\u0082all continue to bring high international awareness of Afghanistan issue, helping the country\u00e2\u0080\u0082to realize\u00e2\u0080\u0082peace, stability\u00e2\u0080\u0082and reconstruction\u00e2\u0080\u0082as soon as possible\u00e2\u0080\u0082while keep moving towards good governance.\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nChina has been all along trying its best to assist Afghan people to tide over the current crisis. Since the fundamental changes in Afghanistan in last August, China has provided the country with over\u00e2\u0080\u0082350 million RMB yuan of urgent humanitarian assistance through bilateral channels. Assistance such as food, medicine, vaccines and winter supplies helped the Afghan people through the hardest and coldest winter. Moreover, China resumed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpine nuts express\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and imported more than 1600 tons of pine nuts via chartered cargo flights. We are also importing signature products such as saffron, almonds, figs and raisins to relieve the Afghan people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficulties through various means. In March 2022, China announced its\u00e2\u0080\u00821 billion yuan of humanitarian and development aid to Afghanistan. After recent earthquake, we provided 50 million RMB yuan\u00e2\u0080\u0099sworth of urgent humanitarian assistance at the earliest possible time. Those tents, blankets, foldable beds, as well as cash donated\u00e2\u0080\u0082from both public and private sectors, includingthe Chinesegovernment, companies and organizations, helped directly and significantly.\n\nFurthermore, China has conducted intensive multilateral coordination on Afghan issue. While actively participating in the UN, Moscow Format and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (SCO) effort in addressing the Afghan issue,\u00e2\u0080\u0082China, together\u00e2\u0080\u0082with our neighboring partners,launched\u00e2\u0080\u0082the Mechanism for Coordination and Cooperation among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan, with the foreign ministers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 meeting as the main body, and helped to shape international consensus of engagement and\u00e2\u0080\u0082regional efforts in stabilizing and assisting Afghanistan. In late March 2022, after State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successful visit to Afghanistan, China hosted the Third Foreign Ministers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan in Tunxi, Anhui Province. The meeting has achieved real and significant results, including Joint Declaration stressing continuous support for Afghanistan, and the Tunxi Initiative focusing on economic rebuilding and practical cooperation, producing\u00e2\u0080\u0082strong call and more actionsfor enhancing peace and stability for Afghanistan and the region.\n\nColleagues,\n\nIt is therefore very timely that today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference is held aiming at \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfghanistan: Security and Economic Development\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Security and development are not only two major challenges for Afghanistan, but also global challenges for all. It is\u00e2\u0080\u0082exactly for tackling with those challenges\u00e2\u0080\u0082that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099sPresident Xi Jinping proposed the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative. President Xi stresses\u00e2\u0080\u0082the need to forge a\u00e2\u0080\u0082united, equal,balanced and inclusive high-quality globaldevelopment partnership\u00e2\u0080\u0082with no country or individual left behind. He also emphasizes\u00e2\u0080\u0082the importance of holding fast the vision forcommon, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security\u00e2\u0080\u0082towards world peace and tranquility. China\u00e2\u0080\u0082would uphold the spirit\u00e2\u0080\u0082of those initiatives and work with the international community and regional countries\u00e2\u0080\u0082in\u00e2\u0080\u0082helping\u00e2\u0080\u0082Afghanistan addressing thoseissues like\u00e2\u0080\u0082governance, stability, economy and people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s livelihood in a systematic way. To that\u00e2\u0080\u0082end, China would like to\u00e2\u0080\u0082enhance coordination and cooperation with allregional and international partners in following aspects:\n\nNumber one,to offer necessary guidance to Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal and external policies\u00e2\u0080\u0082in an appropriate way. Any true\u00e2\u0080\u0082help for Afghan\u00e2\u0080\u0082people\u00e2\u0080\u0082can hardly be materialized if one bypasses the Afghan authority\u00e2\u0080\u0082in operation. Although the acting government has much room for improvement, it is important to engage with it\u00e2\u0080\u0082in an equal and respectful way,whether\u00e2\u0080\u0082to promote inclusive government structure, to bring about moderate and prudent governance or to realize decisive countering of\u00e2\u0080\u0082terrorism. While many have paid extensive attention to women, human rights and education of middle-school girls in Afghanistan, suggestions, guidance\u00e2\u0080\u0082and necessary assistance are to be offered\u00e2\u0080\u0082in a way acceptable for the Afghan authority, to\u00e2\u0080\u0082create\u00e2\u0080\u0082conditionsto genuinely help the matter gain visible progress at\u00e2\u0080\u0082an\u00e2\u0080\u0082earlier\u00e2\u0080\u0082date.\n\nNumber two,\u00e2\u0080\u0082to break the deadlock Afghanistan faces in economic development and people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s livelihood. Development is the ultimate solution to maintaining security. The international community needs to continue to provide Afghanistan with assistance in economy and people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s livelihood, andsupport the UN in playing its role in promoting peace and stability in Afghanistanand coordination for assistance. The acting government of Afghanistan,\u00e2\u0080\u0082as the leading actor in aid distribution and allocation\u00e2\u0080\u0082of foreign aid,\u00e2\u0080\u0082should be respected in clear opposition to\u00e2\u0080\u0082politicization of humanitarian actions. We see it very important to not onlygive\u00e2\u0080\u0082fish to the Afghan people\u00e2\u0080\u0082in need, but also\u00e2\u0080\u0082provide guidance on fishing themselves by strengtheningthe country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity for self-reliant and sustainable recovery, and adopting\u00e2\u0080\u0082a development path that best fits\u00e2\u0080\u0082its own national conditions forindependence, prosperity and social progress.\n\nNumber three,\u00e2\u0080\u0082to improve and enhance\u00e2\u0080\u0082connectivity. Afghanistan sits in the heart of Asia. Many plans of regional inter-connectivity projects, with Afghanistan at\u00e2\u0080\u0082the center, are well underway. China supports all sides in empowering Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location advantages. Under the Belt and Road Initiative, China is ready\u00e2\u0080\u0082to extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor\u00e2\u0080\u0082and\u00e2\u0080\u0082the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor out to Afghanistan. We are also ready\u00e2\u0080\u0082to study how to support the projects such as the Afghanistan-Pakistan Highway\u00e2\u0080\u0082and\u00e2\u0080\u0082the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway. Additionally, we would be happy to see tech firms like ZTE and Huawei go to\u00e2\u0080\u0082Afghanistan and join the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts in\u00e2\u0080\u0082building\u00e2\u0080\u0082and improving\u00e2\u0080\u0082telecommunication network. China is committed to helping improve the inter-connectivity among Central Asia, South Asia and West Asia.\n\nNumber four,to join international efforts to urge lifting any\u00e2\u0080\u0082unilateral sanctions against Afghanistan. Despite the fact that UNSC resolution No. 2615 rules that humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan does not violate UNSC sanctions, many banks refuses\u00e2\u0080\u0082to work with humanitarian institutions in transferring funds to Afghanistan for fear of sanctions from the US. The US should lift unilateral sanctions and unreasonable financial restrictions\u00e2\u0080\u0082as soon as possible if it istruly\u00e2\u0080\u0082supporting\u00e2\u0080\u0082Afghanistan in\u00e2\u0080\u0082obtaining\u00e2\u0080\u0082peace\u00e2\u0080\u0082and reconstruction. As the starter of the Afghan\u00e2\u0080\u0082issue, the US is still avoiding facing up the chaotic situation there and insists onholding\u00e2\u0080\u0082and controlling\u00e2\u0080\u0082Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 7 billion US dollar assets.Afghan people are right now in dire need for life, and the US is dragging its feet in\u00e2\u0080\u0082unfreezing\u00e2\u0080\u0082the assets of the Afghan central bank. The US needs to return in full the 7 billion assets to Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0082right now, and find effective operation and monitoring mechanism\u00e2\u0080\u0082to implement assets unfreezingby working\u00e2\u0080\u0082with the Afghan side on an equal footingto assure\u00e2\u0080\u0082thoseassets are used for Afghan people.\n\nNumber five,\u00e2\u0080\u0082to enhance cooperation in\u00e2\u0080\u0082countering terrorism and strengthening security. According to\u00e2\u0080\u0082recent UN monitoring report, Al-Qaeda is still in close connection with the Taliban, and its operation in Afghanistan expanded. It is necessary to the whole international community to\u00e2\u0080\u0082watch closely the activities of terrorist\u00e2\u0080\u0082groups\u00e2\u0080\u0082in Afghanistan, including the ETIM, and urge the Afghan side to fulfill its promise on countering terrorism\u00e2\u0080\u0082by\u00e2\u0080\u0082taking\u00e2\u0080\u0082visible and verifiable measures. We should enhance cooperation on countering terrorism and security through concrete actions\u00e2\u0080\u0082and eliminate the threat of terrorism in Afghanistan and the region. Any double standards or selective approach on counter-terrorism is unacceptable. Supporting terrorist groups for one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s selfish interest will only make Afghanistan the breeding ground, safe haven and origin of proliferation of terrorism.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nAs an old Chinese\u00e2\u0080\u0082saying goes, however\u00e2\u0080\u0082far or harda journey\u00e2\u0080\u0082shall be, he that keepson going\u00e2\u0080\u0082reaches destination. China is ready\u00e2\u0080\u0082to work with all parties and keep on going to contribute, as our host repeatedly emphasized today \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith joint and combined efforts\u00e2\u0080\u009d, tolasting peace, security, stability and common\u00e2\u0080\u0082prosperity in Afghanistan and the whole region.\n\nThank you.\n\n", "id": "ea43a36db5f83755bae7cdfbda1f138e"}

No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082With the advancement of the international\u00e2\u0080\u0082human rights\u00e2\u0080\u0082cause, freedom from arbitrary detention has become a fundamental individual right\u00e2\u0080\u0082and an important provision in\u00e2\u0080\u0082international human rights treaties.\n\nII. Arbitrary detention of\u00e2\u0080\u0082immigrants in the United States constitutes serious human rights violations\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The US detention of immigrants at its domestic facilities is a serious violation of\u00e2\u0080\u0082the \u00e2\u0080\u009cno use of torture\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082rule. Human rights treaties such as\u00e2\u0080\u0082the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTorture Convention\u00e2\u0080\u009d, customary international law and the laws of different countries\u00e2\u0080\u0082all explicitly prohibit the use of torture. The prohibition of torture has also been recognized as a mandatory legal norm by US courts, international tribunals and the International Law Commission, with special reports issued to prevent related\u00e2\u0080\u0082incidents. However, numerous cases have shown that the US immigration agencies have violated the law and conducted torture against detained immigrants.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In 2018, the US Immigration Council and the US Immigration Lawyers Association filed a complaint with the oversight agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the US Department of Homeland Security,\u00e2\u0080\u0082detailing DHS\u00e2\u0080\u0082policy of family separation at the US border, and its practices of forcing separated families, through extreme coercive means, to give up their legitimate asylum applications in exchange of\u00e2\u0080\u0082resettlement, which has seriously\u00e2\u0080\u0082violated\u00e2\u0080\u0082the prohibition against torture and other abuses, and caused\u00e2\u0080\u0082severe sufferings\u00e2\u0080\u0082and torture to parents and children forcibly separated.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In 2020, the US media revealed that women in custody at the Irvine County Detention Center in Georgia often suffered medical abuse and neglect, and that many received hysterectomies\u00e2\u0080\u0082without proper informed consent\u00e2\u0080\u0082or despite their strong\u00e2\u0080\u0082resistance. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture\u00e2\u0080\u0082and relevant parties have expressed serious concerns on\u00e2\u0080\u0082this issue. The UN human rights authority expressed\u00e2\u0080\u0082strong condemnation\u00e2\u0080\u0082and demanded that the US make an explanation\u00e2\u0080\u0082and take corrective actions\u00e2\u0080\u0082in accordance with its treaty obligations.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has explicitly recognized the conditions that migrants are subjected to while detained in the US as\u00e2\u0080\u0082degrading.\u00e2\u0080\u0082ICE regularly places migrants in local jails and prisons. Even when migrants are placed\u00e2\u0080\u0082into separate immigration detention centers, they still suffer various kinds of physical abuse, including\u00e2\u0080\u0082overcrowding, lack of adequate visitation hours, insufficient\u00e2\u0080\u0082ventilation, poor food, inadequate water, unclean quarters, malfunctioning toilets, and verbal and\u00e2\u0080\u0082physical abuse.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 There is no specific regulations in the US on how long immigrants should be detained, so the length of detention is decided by the place of detention and economic factors.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Some even become indefinite. With limited access to information, the detained immigrants are unable to fight for their\u00e2\u0080\u0082legitimate rights.\u00e2\u0080\u0082The Center for Victims of Torture notes that indefinite detention has damaging\u00e2\u0080\u0082effects on the immune,\u00e2\u0080\u0082cardiovascular and\u00e2\u0080\u0082central nervous systems, and would cause harmful psychological effects including\u00e2\u0080\u0082severe and chronic anxiety and dread, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and suicide.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In March 2022, the Associated Press and CBS News\u00e2\u0080\u0082exposed a\u00e2\u0080\u0082border detention center for unaccompanied children in the Rio Grande Valley, Texas as disorganized and overcrowded, with a high risk of COVID-19 infection. While US federal law requires that\u00e2\u0080\u0082minors should not be held in border detention longer than 72 hours,\u00e2\u0080\u0082over\u00e2\u0080\u00822,000 children have been detained in that facility for more than three days, 39 of them over\u00e2\u0080\u008215 days. In February 2022\u00e2\u0080\u0082alone, more than 9,400 unaccompanied child\u00e2\u0080\u0082immigrants were detained by US border law enforcement and\u00e2\u0080\u0082some 4,000 of them\u00e2\u0080\u0082were held in border custody for more than 72 hours.\n\nIII.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Horrible practices of arbitrary detention by the United States around the world\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 According to BBC reports, as early as in June 2005, the United Nations had been informed that the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082had secretly detained terrorist suspects on its warships. In 2008, the human rights group Reprieve disclosed that the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082had been using \u00e2\u0080\u009cprison boats\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082to hold terrorist\u00e2\u0080\u0082suspects since the Clinton administration. As many as 17 warships may have been used as \u00e2\u0080\u009cfloating prisons\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082from\u00e2\u0080\u00822001\u00e2\u0080\u0082to 2008.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In 2001, The Washington Post\u00e2\u0080\u0082revealed that five inmates were detained on the US amphibious assault ship Peleliu, including an American named John Walker. To reduce his sentence, Walker signed a plea deal\u00e2\u0080\u0082that includes\u00e2\u0080\u0082a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgag order\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082not to talk about his torture in custody, the Guardian reported.\u00e2\u0080\u0082A US Department of Defense Spokesman\u00e2\u0080\u0082denied any detention measures on its warships. However, a prisoner released from Guantanamo told his\u00e2\u0080\u0082probation officer\u00e2\u0080\u0082that one of his fellow inmates\u00e2\u0080\u0082was closed off in the bottom of a US warship with about 50 others before coming to Guantanamo, and was\u00e2\u0080\u0082beaten even more severely than in Guantanamo.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In August 2014, The Atlantic\u00e2\u0080\u0082published an article \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Floating Prison\u00e2\u0080\u009d, disclosing how the US has been using\u00e2\u0080\u0082naval vessels as \u00e2\u0080\u009cfloating prisons\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082at sea to hold and interrogate suspects.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Ahmed Abu Khattala,\u00e2\u0080\u0082identified by the US as the suspect in the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya,\u00e2\u0080\u0082was imprisoned\u00e2\u0080\u0082aboard the USS New York\u00e2\u0080\u0082and questioned by interrogators en route to the US,\u00e2\u0080\u0082before he was formally arrested and transferred to the US District Court in Washington.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In 2017, The New York Times\u00e2\u0080\u0082revealed in \u00e2\u0080\u009cCoast Guard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0098Floating Guantanamo\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d that prisoners recalled being shacked aboard with more than 20 people in a\u00e2\u0080\u0082very crowded space. They got\u00e2\u0080\u0082very little to eat\u00e2\u0080\u0082and had\u00e2\u0080\u0082to take from the trash their guards\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unfinished meals. The sanitary conditions were quite poor. Some even asked the guard: \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust shoot me and kill me, because I cannot take this anymore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The US has set up numerous\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009cblack jails\u00e2\u0080\u009d in countries including Cuba, Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0082and\u00e2\u0080\u0082Iraq,\u00e2\u0080\u0082establishing\u00e2\u0080\u0082a global network of secret prisons. A \u00e2\u0080\u009cCost of War\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082report published in early 2022 by the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University reveals that after the 9/11 attacks, at least 54 countries and regions\u00e2\u0080\u0082have participated in the US black sites network, which has detained hundreds of thousands of people, including Muslims, women and minors. Under the excuse\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cWar on Terror\u00e2\u0080\u009d,\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US has set up black sites in many other countries, covertly\u00e2\u0080\u0082detained alleged\u00e2\u0080\u0082terrorist\u00e2\u0080\u0082suspects, and extracted\u00e2\u0080\u0082confessions\u00e2\u0080\u0082with\u00e2\u0080\u0082torture\u00e2\u0080\u0082and other ill-treatment\u00e2\u0080\u0094all of which typical examples\u00e2\u0080\u0082of its\u00e2\u0080\u0082wanton destruction of the rule of law and violation of human rights.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In 2001, the US set up a prison at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to hold suspects captured by the US military\u00e2\u0080\u0082in its global anti-terrorism operations after the 9/11 attacks. The US chose this location because with the sovereignty of the Guantanamo Bay belonging\u00e2\u0080\u0082to Cuba, this place is legally not US territory; therefore the US could deny\u00e2\u0080\u0082human rights\u00e2\u0080\u0082to the detainees there and evade\u00e2\u0080\u0082charges of human rights abuses\u00e2\u0080\u0082from the international community.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In January 2002, the first 20 detainees\u00e2\u0080\u0082were held outdoors in wire mesh cages\u00e2\u0080\u0082immediately upon arrival\u00e2\u0080\u0082at Guantanamo Bay. In the 20 years afterward, roughly\u00e2\u0080\u0082780 people have been\u00e2\u0080\u0082held at Guantanamo. Scandals of arbitrary detention and torture\u00e2\u0080\u0082there continued to come to light. Moazzam Begg,\u00e2\u0080\u0082a British\u00e2\u0080\u0082Pakistani held there for two years, told the media about the painful experience\u00e2\u0080\u0082of torture - hogtying, punching,\u00e2\u0080\u0082kicking,and waterboarding\u00e2\u0080\u0082- that himself\u00e2\u0080\u0082and other\u00e2\u0080\u0082detainees had gone through. He said that the most vicious torture in the world is to be detained\u00e2\u0080\u0082without knowing what crime has been committed. Without any charge\u00e2\u0080\u0082or\u00e2\u0080\u0082trial, one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal freedom\u00e2\u0080\u0082is gravely compromised.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In March 2003, Pakistani prisoner Majid Khan, accused\u00e2\u0080\u0082of having links to al-Qaeda,\u00e2\u0080\u0082was tortured at Guantanamo. After trial, the military jurors\u00e2\u0080\u0082on this\u00e2\u0080\u0082case wrote a joint letter condemning the US government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuse of prisoners. According to the letter,Majid Khan\u00e2\u0080\u0082was held without charges for nine years and was not allowed\u00e2\u0080\u0082to see a lawyer for the first four\u00e2\u0080\u0082and\u00e2\u0080\u0082a\u00e2\u0080\u0082half years. This is in\u00e2\u0080\u0082complete disregard\u00e2\u0080\u0082of\u00e2\u0080\u0082the fundamental ideas on which the Constitution is based and an affront to American values\u00e2\u0080\u0082and concept of justice. Mr. Khan was subjected to physical and psychological abuse well beyond approved enhanced interrogation techniques. In October 2021, Majid Khan\u00e2\u0080\u0082described for the first time in public the\u00e2\u0080\u0082torture, which included repeated beatings, waterboarding, forced enemas, sexual assault,\u00e2\u0080\u0082and\u00e2\u0080\u0082prolonged sleep deprivation. During the waterboarding,\u00e2\u0080\u0082his head was dunked in water\u00e2\u0080\u0082until he was\u00e2\u0080\u0082almost suffocated.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 The Bagram prison, located 40 kilometers north of the Afghan capital,\u00e2\u0080\u0082Kabul, held thousands of prisoners at one point. The prison has been dubbed Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cGuantanamo Bay\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082because of revelations of abuse at the facility. In December 2002, two Afghan prisoners\u00e2\u0080\u0082were tortured to death by US troops\u00e2\u0080\u0082within a week. In January 2012, the\u00e2\u0080\u0082Independent Commission for\u00e2\u0080\u0082Overseeing\u00e2\u0080\u0082the Implementation of the Constitution\u00e2\u0080\u0082of Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0082made public a report about\u00e2\u0080\u0082beatings and other mistreatment of detainees at\u00e2\u0080\u0082Bagram prison. In February 2012, there was the Quran burning scandal by US soldiers\u00e2\u0080\u0082at Bagram prison. Although\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US troops in Afghanistan officially\u00e2\u0080\u0082handed\u00e2\u0080\u0082over the Bagram prison\u00e2\u0080\u0082to the Afghan government in March 2013, the US military\u00e2\u0080\u0082remains the actual controller of the prison.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In an interview in 2021,\u00e2\u0080\u0082Abdul Qadir Hijran,\u00e2\u0080\u0082former Bagram\u00e2\u0080\u0082prisoner, said in an interview that \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain the torture and ill-treatment they applied to me, but the atrocities they committed would haunt me for years. Thirty-four\u00e2\u0080\u0082inmates were kept in a cage-like room where they\u00e2\u0080\u0082used to live without blankets and mattresses. The detainees were beaten up, tortured and insulted. It was extremely miserable that some detainees had eaten razor to end their lives given the inhuman treatment of the American soldiers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Qazim Azari, a journalist of the Iraqi\u00e2\u0080\u0082newspaper Justice\u00e2\u0080\u0082,\u00e2\u0080\u0082pointed out that the US military willfully detained innocent\u00e2\u0080\u0082people, with torture scandals taking place at\u00e2\u0080\u0082Abu Ghraib prison and Bukaa prison\u00e2\u0080\u0082in Iraq. A large number of innocent Iraqis illegally\u00e2\u0080\u0082detained were\u00e2\u0080\u0082subjected to inhuman physical and mental torture.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086Facing the frequent exposure of serious human rights violations\u00e2\u0080\u0082at\u00e2\u0080\u0082US \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack sites\u00e2\u0080\u009doverseas,the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082government, instead of paying real\u00e2\u0080\u0082attention to and stop all of this,\u00e2\u0080\u0082has continued to cover up and deny its crimes. No US official has been held accountable for developing, authorizing or carrying out covert arrest and torture programs. In December 2002, then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved the use of a range of interrogation techniques at Guantanamo, including sensory deprivation, isolation and the use of vicious dogs. On 30\u00e2\u0080\u0082November\u00e2\u0080\u00822004, The New York Times\u00e2\u0080\u0082published a\u00e2\u0080\u0082report by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)\u00e2\u0080\u0082leaked by the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082government which said that some acts at Guantanamo amounted to torture, and the ICRC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entry into the prison for investigation is conditional on its findings not being revealed. On 16\u00e2\u0080\u0082February 2006, the United Nations released its report on Guantanamo, calling on the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082to either bring the detainees to trial or release them immediately. The US\u00e2\u0080\u0082rejected the recommendation made by\u00e2\u0080\u0082the UN report to shut down\u00e2\u0080\u0082the prison. In 2021, eight UN human rights experts and 111 NGOs signed a joint letter which revealed that\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US government had\u00e2\u0080\u0082been treating\u00e2\u0080\u0082communities of color from the perspective of security threats since 9/11. Guantanamo continues to amplify prejudice and hatred against Muslims, fueling racial division and antagonism in American society.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In November 2002, Gul Rahman, held at\u00e2\u0080\u0082Bagram prison in Afghanistan, died of coldness\u00e2\u0080\u0082and torture, according to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCost of War\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082project findings. Four months later, the officer in charge of the interrogation was awarded a CIA commendation and US$2,500 in cash awards.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Several\u00e2\u0080\u0082other\u00e2\u0080\u0082staff members involved in the torture were given promotions and bonuses. In 2004, hundreds of prisoner abuse photos at\u00e2\u0080\u0082Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq\u00e2\u0080\u0082were disclosed by the US media.\u00e2\u0080\u0082But\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US military personnel, senior government officials and\u00e2\u0080\u0082private military contractors\u00e2\u0080\u0082involved have\u00e2\u0080\u0082been spared trial.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Only some low-level US soldiers went through military trials and got convicted.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086 In 2005, CIA officers intentionally destroyed 92 videotapes containing direct evidence of torture.\u00e2\u0080\u0082But\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US Department of Justice has so far refused to bring charges against those involved. In 2020, the ICC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chief prosecutor said there was evidence that nearly 100 Afghan prisoners had been tortured, abused and even sexually assaulted during interrogations, and that the US military and the CIA may have committed war crimes for abusing prisoners in Afghanistan. However, this only made\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US government impose\u00e2\u0080\u0082economic sanctions and entry restrictions on the ICC chief prosecutor\u00e2\u0080\u0082and other officials. In response to the UN Committee Against Torture\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report on the abuse of torture at\u00e2\u0080\u0082the CIA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overseas \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack sites\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the US government\u00e2\u0080\u0082submitted a report in September 2021\u00e2\u0080\u0082claiming\u00e2\u0080\u0082that based on confidentiality, the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082cannot disclose information to other countries about detainees involved in the CIA activities.\n\nIV. Reasons for the Abuse\u00e2\u0080\u0082of Arbitrary Detention by the United States\n\nThe United States has a long history of arbitrary detention and disregard of\u00e2\u0080\u0082human rights both at home and abroad, reflecting a deep-seated\u00e2\u0080\u0082political culture of racism and violence.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086In recent years, racial conflicts have once again become one of the\u00e2\u0080\u0082principal problems\u00e2\u0080\u0082in American politics and society. One reason is that racism has been a chronic problem of the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082since its founding.\u00e2\u0080\u0082The cultural superiority and dominant position\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the white people\u00e2\u0080\u0082have led to a high degree of political, economic and cultural inequality\u00e2\u0080\u0082among racial groups\u00e2\u0080\u0082in the US. Another reason is that\u00e2\u0080\u0082globalization and major demographic changes\u00e2\u0080\u0082in the US have in recent years\u00e2\u0080\u0082caused increasing grudges among\u00e2\u0080\u0082the white Americans,\u00e2\u0080\u0082the\u00e2\u0080\u0082lower-middle\u00e2\u0080\u0082class in particular,\u00e2\u0080\u0082against immigrants and ethnic minorities, aggravating\u00e2\u0080\u0082the problem of racism in the US.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The rise of white supremacy in the US has exacerbated\u00e2\u0080\u0082racial conflicts. Recent years\u00e2\u0080\u0082have witnessed\u00e2\u0080\u0082large-scale minority protests\u00e2\u0080\u0082represented by the Black Lives Matter\u00e2\u0080\u0082Movement and frequent refugee crises\u00e2\u0080\u0082in border\u00e2\u0080\u0082areas. Race-based arbitrary detention\u00e2\u0080\u0082tramples\u00e2\u0080\u0082on the basic human rights of ethnic minorities and foreign immigrants\u00e2\u0080\u0082and\u00e2\u0080\u0082runs counter to\u00e2\u0080\u0082the human rights principles long proclaimed by the US, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009call men are created equal\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\u00e2\u0080\u0082It will not help\u00e2\u0080\u0082resolve the problem of illegal immigration. Rather, it further tears apart\u00e2\u0080\u0082American society, creating social wounds that are difficult to heal. Democracy and human rights in the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082are not enjoyed by\u00e2\u0080\u0082all, but only by\u00e2\u0080\u0082some. Tolerance and pluralism of American society are conditioned on the absolute dominance of the white people.\n\n\u00e2\u0097\u0086The fact that the US has arbitrarily detained illegal immigrants at home and set up a large number of \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack sites\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082abroad\u00e2\u0080\u0082to create cases of arbitrary detention\u00e2\u0080\u0082reflects its\u00e2\u0080\u0082deep-seated\u00e2\u0080\u0082hegemonic\u00e2\u0080\u0082and\u00e2\u0080\u0082unilateralist thinking and violent political culture. As long as the embedded racism remains, there will be no true integration and equality\u00e2\u0080\u0082in\u00e2\u0080\u0082the American society. As long as hegemonism and power politics persist, the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082will keep resorting to\u00e2\u0080\u0082violent means\u00e2\u0080\u0082in resolving issues across the world, and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack sites\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082and arbitrary detention will continue to exist.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe fact that the United States has carried out arbitrary detention at home and abroad has laid bare\u00e2\u0080\u0082its hypocrisy and double standards with regard to human rights. The US\u00e2\u0080\u0082groundlessly accuses others of arbitrary detention, while\u00e2\u0080\u0082at the same time, however, does not mention\u00e2\u0080\u0082a word about\u00e2\u0080\u0082the torture and maltreatment common at\u00e2\u0080\u0082its own prisons.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Arbitrarily throwing\u00e2\u0080\u0082people into its \u00e2\u0080\u009cblack sites\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082around the world without trial has become a hallmark\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the US trampling on the rule of law and infringing on human rights. The US\u00e2\u0080\u0082should face up to and reflect upon its own serious human rights violations,stop politicizing human rights issues, and stop undermining the human rights of people\u00e2\u0080\u0082of other countries.\n\n", "id": "eabcd5dd740d387bbcaefb7c17de14e0"}

Ambassador of New Zealand to China Grahame Robert Morton, and responsible officials of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Commerce, and Ministry of Education, among others, attended the event.\n\nIn his remarks, Xie Feng quoted a Maori proverb of New Zealand that without foresight or vision people will be lost. Last year, China and New Zealand jointly celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, and leaders of the two countries successfully held a meeting in Bangkok, showing a clear direction for the development of China-New Zealand relations. China is now advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nations on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. New Zealand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government led by the Labour Party has also set development goals by 2030. It is the right timing for China and New Zealand to expand mutually beneficial cooperation and achieve more outcomes.

Welcome to the\u00e2\u0080\u0082briefing.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Today I would like to take this opportunity to present the positions of the Chinese government on the Japanese government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unilateral decision to discharge Fukushima nuclear contaminated water into the ocean.\n\nAs we all know, twelve years ago, on March 11, 2011, a nuclear accident of\u00e2\u0080\u0082the highest level occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in Japan. Three reactor cores were melted and damaged, releasing a large amount of radioactive materials. The Fukushima nuclear accident has brought a heavy disaster to the Japanese people. The Chinese government and people have expressed deep sympathy and provided necessary assistance within our best capacity to the Japanese government and people. Regrettably, however, with regard to\u00e2\u0080\u0082the disposal of the nuclear contaminated water from the Fukushima accident, Japan has unilaterally decided to discharge the nuclear contaminated water into the ocean, in total disregard of the concerns and interests of the people from China and other\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082countries\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the world. I would like to\u00e2\u0080\u0082make\u00e2\u0080\u0082the following points.\n\nFirst, we cannot neglect the harm caused by the discharge of the nuclear contaminated water into the ocean. The\u00e2\u0080\u0082seawater brought by the tsunami, the\u00e2\u0080\u0082cooling water\u00e2\u0080\u0082injected into the reactor cores and\u00e2\u0080\u0082the\u00e2\u0080\u0082groundwater and rainwater that came into contact with the reactor cores were all contaminated, producing a large amount of nuclear contaminated water.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Initial assessment shows\u00e2\u0080\u0082that the nuclear contaminated water contains more than 60 radionuclides, including tritium, carbon-14, cobalt-60, strontium-90, iodine-129, etc. The half-life of tritium is about 13 years, and that of carbon-14 is more than 5000 years. There is not yet\u00e2\u0080\u0082effective technology to treat\u00e2\u0080\u0082many of those radionuclides. Some long-lived\u00e2\u0080\u0082radionuclides may spread with the ocean currents\u00e2\u0080\u0082and form a bio-concentration effect, which will\u00e2\u0080\u0082multiply\u00e2\u0080\u0082the total amount of radionuclides in the environment, causing unpredictable harm to the marine environment and human health. \u00e2\u0080\u0082Therefore, it is incumbent on Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0082to respond to the concerns of the international community and dispose of\u00e2\u0080\u0082the nuclear contaminated water in a responsible manner consistent with international legal\u00e2\u0080\u0082obligations, international safety standards and good practices.\n\nSecond, the disposal of nuclear contaminated water\u00e2\u0080\u0082from Fukushima\u00e2\u0080\u0082is by no means Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private matter.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Until now, the Fukushima nuclear accident has generated more than 1.3 million tons of contaminated water, with about 100 tons being\u00e2\u0080\u0082further\u00e2\u0080\u0082produced every day. That contaminated water\u00e2\u0080\u0082was stored temporarily in over 1,000 storage tanks, which is\u00e2\u0080\u0082expected to be discharged into the ocean over a period of 30 years. According to\u00e2\u0080\u0082the\u00e2\u0080\u0082research by a German marine research institution, within 57 days of the discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the Fukushima nuclear contaminated water, the radioactive materials\u00e2\u0080\u0082will spread to most of the Pacific Ocean and, in\u00e2\u0080\u008210 years, to the waters\u00e2\u0080\u0082across the world. Therefore, the discharge of nuclear contaminated water has cross-border impact on the marine environment and public health. Stakeholders such as China, Republic of Korea, Russia, DPRK\u00e2\u0080\u0082and other Japanese neighbors and Pacific island countries have\u00e2\u0080\u0082repeatedly expressed their grave concern over Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong decision. Last month, the Pacific Island Forum (PIF) Secretary General Mr. Henry Puna\u00e2\u0080\u0082stressed\u00e2\u0080\u0082that Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to discharge the nuclear contaminated water\u00e2\u0080\u0082into the sea is not a domestic matter of Japan, but a global issue. There are also strong voices of opposition within Japan. However, Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0082has\u00e2\u0080\u0082failed to conduct full and meaningful consultations with its neighbors and other stakeholders. On 13\u00e2\u0080\u0082April 2021, Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0082unilaterally decided to discharge the nuclear contaminated water into the ocean\u00e2\u0080\u0082after treatment. It is only logical and legitimate for China and other stakeholders to express\u00e2\u0080\u0082our\u00e2\u0080\u0082concern\u00e2\u0080\u0082over\u00e2\u0080\u0082and firm opposition to\u00e2\u0080\u0082that decision.\n\nThird, Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to discharge the Fukushima nuclear contaminated water into the ocean\u00e2\u0080\u0082is driven by selfish interests. The disposal\u00e2\u0080\u0082of nuclear contaminated water should be decided upon\u00e2\u0080\u0082with the greatest prudence, and there is no precedent \u00e2\u0080\u0082in\u00e2\u0080\u0082discharging nuclear contaminated water\u00e2\u0080\u0082caused by nuclear accident\u00e2\u0080\u0082into the ocean. We know that Japan initially\u00e2\u0080\u0082proposed five ways to dispose of\u00e2\u0080\u0082nuclear contaminated water, including injection into the ground, discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0082into the ocean, vapor release, release as hydrogen gas into the atmosphere\u00e2\u0080\u0082and underground burial. However, we believe that Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0082did not conduct thorough study of the\u00e2\u0080\u0082other disposal options except for\u00e2\u0080\u0082ocean discharge. Instead,\u00e2\u0080\u0082Japan uses limited space as an excuse to stop building new storage tanks and decide to discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0082the nuclear contaminated water into the ocean,\u00e2\u0080\u0082transferring\u00e2\u0080\u0082the risks to all mankind and other countries.\n\nFourth, Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0082has not seriously responded to international concerns and addressed them\u00e2\u0080\u0082accordingly. There are a lot of questions left unanswered. For example,\u00e2\u0080\u0082is ocean discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0082the best option? If the\u00e2\u0080\u0082treated nuclear contaminated water indeed meets the relevant discharge standards, as claimed by the Japanese government, then\u00e2\u0080\u0082why\u00e2\u0080\u0082not discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0082it domestically? According to media reports,\u00e2\u0080\u0082the Tokyo Electric Power Company\u00e2\u0080\u0082(TEPCO) has a track record of data tampering, is the data it released\u00e2\u0080\u0082on nuclear contaminated\u00e2\u0080\u0082water still\u00e2\u0080\u0082trustworthy? How can it prove the effectiveness and long-term reliability of the nuclear contaminated water purification devices? Is Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environmental impact assessment report comprehensive and scientific, and can it ensure that there will be no negative impact on the environment? Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0082has yet to provide\u00e2\u0080\u0082sufficient scientific and convincing explanations on the above questions. China has expressed concerns to Japan,\u00e2\u0080\u0082based on the spirit of science and out of the sense of responsibility for the health of our\u00e2\u0080\u0082own people, the global marine environment and international public interest. In May 2022, China and Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0082submitted\u00e2\u0080\u0082to Japan a\u00e2\u0080\u0082Joint List of Technical Questions on the Disposal of the Japanese Fukushima Nuclear Contaminated Water,\u00e2\u0080\u0082and distributed it at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In November last year, China and Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0082distributed the\u00e2\u0080\u0082Feedback on Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Response to the Joint List of Technical Questions\u00e2\u0080\u0082(the second question list)\u00e2\u0080\u0082at the IAEA, but Japan has not yet responded. In February this year, the Pacific Island Forum (PIF) stated that, according to the independent assessment of the PIF Panel of Experts, there is insufficient data to classify the impending discharge by Japan as safe for Pacific people and the ocean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biodiversity, and\u00e2\u0080\u0082Japan only provided limited data and information despite\u00e2\u0080\u0082the PIF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repeated requests. All these facts show that it is time for Japan to face up to the concerns of the international community\u00e2\u0080\u0082and provide responsible clarifications.\n\nFifth, Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0082actually didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0082show due respect to the authority of the relevant international organization, namely the IAEA. Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0082claimed\u00e2\u0080\u0082that its discharge plan\u00e2\u0080\u0082was endorsed by the IAEA. This\u00e2\u0080\u0082is not true. In fact, the IAEA Task Force has not yet finished its review\u00e2\u0080\u0082and assessment.\u00e2\u0080\u0082There is no final\u00e2\u0080\u0082conclusion yet. On the contrary, the IAEA Task Force\u00e2\u0080\u0082found that the plan\u00e2\u0080\u0082was inconsistent with the IAEA safety standards\u00e2\u0080\u0082in many areas. In spite of that, Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0082insisted on pushing through the discharge plan in July last year\u00e2\u0080\u0082and stepped up\u00e2\u0080\u0082construction of the\u00e2\u0080\u0082discharge\u00e2\u0080\u0082pipelines. Just before\u00e2\u0080\u0082the visit by IAEA Task Force to Japan on January 16\u00e2\u0080\u0082this year, Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0082announced that it would start\u00e2\u0080\u0082discharging the nuclear contaminated water\u00e2\u0080\u0082around spring or summer this year. This is not an action that\u00e2\u0080\u0082a responsible country is supposed to take. This is in violation of\u00e2\u0080\u0082Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal\u00e2\u0080\u0082obligations under the international law.\n\nFriends\u00e2\u0080\u0082from the press,\n\nTo conclude\u00e2\u0080\u0082my introduction, the Pacific Ocean is not Japan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sewer for discharging its nuclear contaminated water. Japan should take an objective and science-based approach, and dispose\u00e2\u0080\u0082of\u00e2\u0080\u0082the nuclear contaminated water in a way that is safe and consistent with the international law, the international safety standards and good practices. That includes a thorough examination of alternative disposal options other than ocean discharge. There should be no discharge until all stakeholders and relevant international organizations confirm that such a discharge is safe and secure. China again urges Japan to take seriously the legitimate concerns of the international community, earnestly fulfill its international obligations, conduct full consultation with its neighbors, stakeholders and the relevant international institutions, dispose of the nuclear contaminated water in a science-based, open, transparent and safe manner, place itself under strict international monitoring and take credible steps to protect the marine environment and the health rights and interests of all peoples.\n\n", "id": "ee8e6b166df53cf393f550211288a51f"}

Ikezoe Yoichi. They exchanged in-depth views on China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy and China-Japan relations, among others, in a friendly manner.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy has strong resilience, great potential and full vitality, with its super-large-scale market and unparalleled industrial agglomeration and supporting industries, as well as the remarkable achievements in the overall level and upgrading speed of infrastructure and human resources. China has always been a promising destination for foreign enterprises to invest and do business, and governments at all levels in China will, as always, promote the policy of opening up and attracting foreign investment, and strive to create a more favorable business environment for Chinese and foreign enterprises by treating them as equals. China always cares about and actively resolves the legitimate concerns and demands of Japanese enterprises and other foreign enterprises in China, and is glad to see Japanese enterprises seizing the opportunity to further develop in the Chinese market.\n\nLiu Jinsong said that recently, the Chinese government has adapted its COVID-19 response measures based on science and in light of the latest situation, injecting strong impetus into China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy and bringing new opportunities for cross-border travel and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the rest of the world. Many neighboring countries welcome Chinese tourists, and many political figures have also delivered warm speeches. China appreciates all these. That being said, China also expresses its strong dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures taken by certain countries targeting Chinese tourists. This is a typical \u00e2\u0080\u009cformalist hypocrisy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdouble standards\u00e2\u0080\u009d, unscientific, unprofessional, discriminatory and politicized, and is also very unfavorable to the cooperation between China and the rest of the world in industrial and supply chains, in particular business exchanges. Liu expressed his belief that the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China has noted this issue and will play a constructive role.\n\nLiu Jinsong noted that China and Japan have very close and mutually beneficial economic and trade relations. This is the result of the hard work of generations of the two countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 people, including the Japanese business and industrial circles, and is a major foundation and highlight of bilateral relations, which should be cherished and maintained. Both sides should follow economic laws, uphold business and market rules, respect entrepreneurship and the principle of free trade, and strive to forestall the interference of non-economic factors and third-party factors in economic, trade and investment cooperation, so as to avoid overstretching the concept of national security and other improper measures from impacting the operational efficiency of enterprises and increasing business costs. Ideologizing cooperation in industrial and supply chains does not conform to the trend of the times and the interests of the industrial and commercial circles, and hurts others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interests without benefiting oneself.\n\nIkezoe Yoichi recalled the extraordinary history and achievements of Itochu (China) Holding Co., Ltd. in investing and operating in China, and said that Japanese enterprises value China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s market opportunities and always have confidence in the prospects of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy. Ikezoe Yoichi said that he believes China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adjustment to the COVID-19 response policy will better facilitate the operation of Japanese enterprises in China, and looks forward to further expanding economic and trade cooperation with China.

The two\u00e2\u0080\u0082parties, although not unaware of\u00e2\u0080\u0082the age-old ills of American democracy, have neither the resolve nor the courage to pursue changes, given the increasingly polarized political atmosphere, as well as their focus on party interests.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nIn 2022, the US Congress was brought into another paralysis,\u00e2\u0080\u0082not by\u00e2\u0080\u0082riots, but\u00e2\u0080\u0082by\u00e2\u0080\u0082partisan fights. The farce of failing to elect the 118th House\u00e2\u0080\u0082speaker lasted four days and a decision was only reached after 15 rounds of voting. In the last round, divisions were such that Republicans and Democrats voted strictly along party lines. The New York Times\u00e2\u0080\u0082warned that\u00e2\u0080\u0082Congress could see repeated chaos like this\u00e2\u0080\u0082over the next two years.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Brad Bannon, president of a US\u00e2\u0080\u0082political consultancy, put it bluntly,\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe impasse in\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US House of Representatives over the election of the Speaker is another demonstration of the decline in our political institutions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis has aroused concerns among the general public.\u00e2\u0080\u0082The Brookings Institution concludes in a 2022\u00e2\u0080\u0082report that\u00e2\u0080\u0082the once proud American democracy is\u00e2\u0080\u0082facing a systemic crisis and is\u00e2\u0080\u0082accelerating its decline. The\u00e2\u0080\u0082impact\u00e2\u0080\u0082is spreading to all fronts\u00e2\u0080\u0082in\u00e2\u0080\u0082domestic politics,\u00e2\u0080\u0082the\u00e2\u0080\u0082economy and society,\u00e2\u0080\u0082posing a mortal threat to the legitimacy and health of capitalism.\u00e2\u0080\u0082The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace warns in a report that American democracy is\u00e2\u0080\u0082at a dangerous inflection\u00e2\u0080\u0082point,\u00e2\u0080\u0082declining faster as the inherent ills of American capitalism worsen. Multiple challenges such as voting restrictions, election\u00e2\u0080\u0082fraud, and loss of trust in government are\u00e2\u0080\u0082accelerating\u00e2\u0080\u0082the disintegration of American democracy. Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, writes\u00e2\u0080\u0082that America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dysfunctional politics raises fears that the\u00e2\u0080\u00822024 presidential election would again provoke deadly violence in the country. A large number of hot\u00e2\u0080\u0082button issues continued\u00e2\u0080\u0082to provoke public anger and questions on the legitimacy of the US political establishment. Many worried about how long American\u00e2\u0080\u0082democracy could\u00e2\u0080\u0082continue to function.\n\n2.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Political polarization intensified by partisan\u00e2\u0080\u0082fights\n\nWith radical factions rising in both the Democratic\u00e2\u0080\u0082and Republican\u00e2\u0080\u0082Parties,\u00e2\u0080\u0082the two were\u00e2\u0080\u0082increasingly at odds\u00e2\u0080\u0082in\u00e2\u0080\u0082many aspects, such as\u00e2\u0080\u0082voter base, ideology and identity. As a result, the\u00e2\u0080\u0082traditional inter-party balance based on policy compromise became more difficult to sustain. The two parties saw\u00e2\u0080\u0082each other not only as political opponents, but also as a threat to the country. The New York Review of Books points\u00e2\u0080\u0082out that America\u00e2\u0080\u0082is already \u00e2\u0080\u009ca binational state\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the Republicans\u00e2\u0080\u0082and Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0082leading two sharply opposed national communities that effectively operate as confederations under a single federal government. The United States of America has\u00e2\u0080\u0082become the\u00e2\u0080\u0082disunited states.\u00e2\u0080\u0082The discord between \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe two Americas\u00e2\u0080\u009d was\u00e2\u0080\u0082deepening day by day, and political polarization reached an unprecedented level.\n\nAmid the escalating political battles, politicians put the interests of their political parties and factions above those of the country and acted in an unbridled way to attack and pin blames on each other.\u00e2\u0080\u0082On 8 August\u00e2\u0080\u00822022, law enforcement\u00e2\u0080\u0082raided former President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mar-a-Lago residence, and Trump accused\u00e2\u0080\u0082the Justice Department of\u00e2\u0080\u0082playing politics to stop his second presidential bid and of political persecution. The Republicans, on their part, were relentless on the discovery of\u00e2\u0080\u0082classified documents in President Joe Biden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s residence, launched investigations into the Biden administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0082withdrawal from Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0082and demanded\u00e2\u0080\u0082accountability.\u00e2\u0080\u0082US\u00e2\u0080\u0082state apparatus was reduced to a tool for political\u00e2\u0080\u0082parties\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0082self-interest.\n\nParty politics increasingly followed\u00e2\u0080\u0082race and identity\u00e2\u0080\u0082lines. According to the\u00e2\u0080\u0082Financial Times, Republicans are white, small town and rural while Democrats are now almost entirely urban and multi-ethnic. More than a third of Republicans and Democrats today believe violence is justified to achieve their\u00e2\u0080\u0082political ends. When one\u00e2\u0080\u0082party loses, its voters feel as though\u00e2\u0080\u0082their America\u00e2\u0080\u0082is being occupied by a foreign power. Political scientist Barbara Walter\u00e2\u0080\u0082considers\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US \u00e2\u0080\u009ca factionalized anocracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the halfway state between autocracy and democracy.\n\nPolitical polarization\u00e2\u0080\u0082was more of an obstacle to policy decision-making. GovTrack,\u00e2\u0080\u0082an online non-governmental source of legislative information and statistics, reveals a steady fall in\u00e2\u0080\u0082the number of laws successive US Congresses could enact \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0082from 4,247 by\u00e2\u0080\u0082the 93th to 98th\u00e2\u0080\u0082Congresses down to 2,081 by\u00e2\u0080\u0082the 111st to 116th. The drop\u00e2\u0080\u0082was even more pronounced\u00e2\u0080\u0082when one considers how many bills could become laws,\u00e2\u0080\u0082from 6%\u00e2\u0080\u0082in the 106th\u00e2\u0080\u0082Congress to 1%\u00e2\u0080\u0082in the 116th, a slide\u00e2\u0080\u0082of 5 percentage points over two decades.\n\nThe tactics used in partisan fights were more scandalous.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Professor Larry Diamond of Political Science and Sociology at Stanford University believes\u00e2\u0080\u0082the norms of democracy, such as self-restraint in the exercise\u00e2\u0080\u0082of power and rejection of violence, which should have been observed by the participating parties in elections, have begun disintegrating in the US.\u00e2\u0080\u0082A growing number of politicians and elected officials in the US have been willing to bend or abandon democratic norms in the quest to achieve or retain power. And as common political ground vanishes, rising proportions of Americans in both camps express attitudes and perceptions that are blinking red for democratic peril. Democracy in the US is at serious risk of breaking down.\n\n3.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Money politics surged\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMake money your\u00e2\u0080\u0082god, and it will plague you like the devil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082so admonished British playwright Henry Fielding.\u00e2\u0080\u0082In the US, money is the breast milk of politics\u00e2\u0080\u0082and elections increasingly morph into\u00e2\u0080\u0082monologues of the wealthy, while the public call\u00e2\u0080\u0082for democracy is made only\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009ca jarring note\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\u00e2\u0080\u0082With the\u00e2\u0080\u0082devil\u00e2\u0080\u0082of money lurking in\u00e2\u0080\u0082every corner of American politics, fairness and justice is naturally strained.\n\nThe\u00e2\u0080\u0082latest illustration is the\u00e2\u0080\u00822022 midterm elections. The whole exercise has a price tag\u00e2\u0080\u0082of more than US$16.7 billion\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 breaking the 2018\u00e2\u0080\u0082record\u00e2\u0080\u0082of US$14 billion\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 as found by\u00e2\u0080\u0082Reveal, an online platform\u00e2\u0080\u0082tracking\u00e2\u0080\u0082the flow of\u00e2\u0080\u0082political donations\u00e2\u0080\u0082in the country. This amount dwarfs\u00e2\u0080\u0082the\u00e2\u0080\u00822021\u00e2\u0080\u0082GDPs\u00e2\u0080\u0082of more than 70 countries. Federal Senate races in some states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Ohio sucked in\u00e2\u0080\u0082more than US$100 million on average. Over\u00e2\u0080\u008290%\u00e2\u0080\u0082of those elected\u00e2\u0080\u0082as lawmakers\u00e2\u0080\u0082won by splurging funds.

Billionaires provided\u00e2\u0080\u008215.4%\u00e2\u0080\u0082of federal election funds, and most of it\u00e2\u0080\u0082went\u00e2\u0080\u0082to super PACs that can accept unlimited donations.\n\nThe\u00e2\u0080\u0082enormous\u00e2\u0080\u0082bills\u00e2\u0080\u0082did not bring\u00e2\u0080\u0082effective national governance\u00e2\u0080\u0082in return. They only\u00e2\u0080\u0082stimulated pork barrel politics. An article on Lianhe Zaobao\u00e2\u0080\u0082observes that\u00e2\u0080\u0082the past few decades has witnessed a decay in Western democracy.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Wealth is\u00e2\u0080\u0082increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, making the poor poorer and the rich richer. Politics is\u00e2\u0080\u0082controlled by the rich and politicians to serve their own interests. Despite a\u00e2\u0080\u0082right to vote, the public does\u00e2\u0080\u0082not\u00e2\u0080\u0082have real sway over\u00e2\u0080\u0082politics. This sense of powerlessness and loss of confidence in\u00e2\u0080\u0082political\u00e2\u0080\u0082parties and government has given rise to populism, and the problem remains unresolved.\n\n4.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009cFreedom of speech\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082in name only\n\nThe United States has always prided itself on free speech. In reality, however, freedom of speech in the United States is upheld according to self-centered \u00e2\u0080\u009cUS standards\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Partisan interest and money politics have become the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo big mountains\u00e2\u0080\u009d that weigh on free speech. Any speech that is detrimental to the interests of the US government or capital is subject to strict restrictions.\n\nThe US government has all-encompassing regulations on media and technology companies to intervene in public opinion. In December 2022, Twitter CEO Elon Musk and journalist Matt Taibbi posted back-to-back tweets that exposed \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwitter files\u00e2\u0080\u009d, revealing that the US government is heavily scrutinizing all social media companies. Sometimes it directly intervenes in big media companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reporting, like frequently having Google remove certain links. Twitter censored sensitive information about presidential candidates ahead of the 2020 election, creating \u00e2\u0080\u009cblacklists\u00e2\u0080\u009d to limit the exposure of unpopular accounts and even hot topics, and working with the FBI to monitor social media content, all the while giving the US military the green light to spread disinformation online. All this has undoubtedly torn off the fig leaf of free speech in the United States.\n\nCapital and interest groups basically can get anything they want when it comes to public opinion. In the face of capital and interest groups,\u00e2\u0080\u0082American media\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreedom of speech\u00e2\u0080\u009d smacks of hypocrisy.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Most American media\u00e2\u0080\u0082firms\u00e2\u0080\u0082are privately owned and serve the powerful and the rich. Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0082the owner of the media or the investment and advertisement income that the media depends on, all of them are related to\u00e2\u0080\u0082capital and interest groups. In his book The Hypocritical Superpower,\u00e2\u0080\u0082Micheal Lueders, a well-known German writer and media professional, elaborated\u00e2\u0080\u0082in detail how the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfiltering mechanism\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082of American media, under the\u00e2\u0080\u0082influence of interest groups, chooses and distorts facts. In January 2023, Project Veritas, an American right-wing group, published a video about Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0082that went viral. It recorded\u00e2\u0080\u0082Jordon\u00e2\u0080\u0082Trishton Walker, a senior executive at Pfizer, saying\u00e2\u0080\u0082that Pfizer was exploring plans to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmutate\u00e2\u0080\u009d the coronavirus, that the coronavirus vaccine business was a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccash cow\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and that US regulators had vested interests in\u00e2\u0080\u0082drug companies. To deal with the PR crisis, in addition to issuing a\u00e2\u0080\u0082statement, Pfizer even had YouTube remove the video immediately on ground of \u00e2\u0080\u009cviolating community guidelines\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe US uses social media to manipulate international public opinion. In December 2022, the independent investigation website \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Intercept\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082revealed that agencies affiliated to the US Department of Defense had long interfered in public opinion in Middle Eastern countries by\u00e2\u0080\u0082manipulating topics and waging deceptive propaganda on social media such as Twitter. In July 2017, US Central Command official Nathaniel Kahler sent to the Twitter public policy team a form containing 52 Arabic-language accounts, asking for priority services for six of them. Following Kahler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request, Twitter put these\u00e2\u0080\u0082Arabic accounts on a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhite list\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082to amplify messages favorable to the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Eric Sperling, executive director of Just\u00e2\u0080\u0082Foreign Policy, an anti-war organization, commented on this incident that\u00e2\u0080\u0082Congress and social media companies should investigate and take action to ensure that, at the very least, the\u00e2\u0080\u0082citizens are fully informed when their tax money is being spent on putting a positive spin on the\u00e2\u0080\u0082endless wars.\n\nIn September 2022, the explosion of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNord Stream\u00e2\u0080\u009d natural gas pipeline shocked the world, and the international community\u00e2\u0080\u0082was eager to know the identity and motive of the perpetrator. On\u00e2\u0080\u00828\u00e2\u0080\u0082February 2023, Pulitzer\u00e2\u0080\u0082Prize-winning veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published\u00e2\u0080\u0082an article exposing\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US government as the culprit of\u00e2\u0080\u0082the incident. However, American and European\u00e2\u0080\u0082mainstream media, known for their\u00e2\u0080\u0082sensitivity\u00e2\u0080\u0082to such scoops,\u00e2\u0080\u0082stayed eerily quiet on\u00e2\u0080\u0082this piece of explosive\u00e2\u0080\u0082news. As observed by Canadian website\u00e2\u0080\u0082Western Standard\u00e2\u0080\u0082and German television\u00e2\u0080\u0082channel ZDF, Hersh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report was one of the biggest stories\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the decade, but few media in North America wanted to talk about it\u00e2\u0080\u0082because\u00e2\u0080\u0082the West does not want anyone to find out about the truth and the surveillance technologies\u00e2\u0080\u0082it has deployed in the Baltic Sea. Western media even try to bypass the crux of the issue by questioning\u00e2\u0080\u0082the authenticity of Hersh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report. On 15\u00e2\u0080\u0082February, Hersh wrote another article,\u00e2\u0080\u0082accusing the US government and mainstream media of covering up the truth of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNord Stream\u00e2\u0080\u009d pipeline explosion. Analysts pointed out that given\u00e2\u0080\u0082Western media\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obedience to the US, their\u00e2\u0080\u0082blocking of Hersh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revelations is not surprising.\n\n5.\u00e2\u0080\u0082The judicial system blind to\u00e2\u0080\u0082public opinion\n\nAs an\u00e2\u0080\u0082institution\u00e2\u0080\u0082undergirding the\u00e2\u0080\u0082country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Constitution, the US Supreme Court, like the American society, has become deeply divided. Judicial power\u00e2\u0080\u0082is hijacked by public opinion, and partisan\u00e2\u0080\u0082struggle\u00e2\u0080\u0082has spread to the judicial system. Increasingly, Supreme Court decisions reflect the huge chasm\u00e2\u0080\u0082between \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo Americas\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094the conservatives\u00e2\u0080\u0082and liberals,\u00e2\u0080\u0082and have\u00e2\u0080\u0082been reduced to a tool of political warfare. The\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009cseparation of powers\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082is constantly being eroded. Partisanship has abandoned tradition and crossed the line.\n\nBoth parties pursue\u00e2\u0080\u0082their agenda by changing the political orientation of the Supreme Court. The presidential election has in some ways become a partisan battle for the right to appoint judges. The passing away of Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0082justices gave Trump the opportunity to appoint during his term three\u00e2\u0080\u0082justices who took a conservative stance, giving conservative justices an overwhelming advantage over liberal ones. After Trump, radical white evangelical fundamentalists have taken the reins of the Supreme Court, according to an article on the South African website Daily Maverick. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hardly surprising that the Supreme Court almost always makes decisions in favor of Christian evangelicals, big corporations and the Republican Party.\n\nThe US Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision on abortion rights fully demonstrates the consequences of being involved in partisan warfare and out of touch with society. On 24\u00e2\u0080\u0082June 2022, the Supreme Court flagrantly\u00e2\u0080\u0082endorsed\u00e2\u0080\u0082religious conservatism by overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and removing constitutional protections for women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abortion rights. The decision triggered\u00e2\u0080\u0082protests across the United States. Polls show that more than half of Americans believe that stripping away abortion rights is a setback for the country. Israeli media\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaaretz\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082commented that on\u00e2\u0080\u0082the issue of abortion rights, the Supreme Court has undermined\u00e2\u0080\u0082democracy\u00e2\u0080\u0082in the name of defending it, which is a typical case of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctyranny\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the minority\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Here is an unrepresentative Supreme Court, with its\u00e2\u0080\u0082justices appointed by an unrepresentative president\u00e2\u0080\u0082and\u00e2\u0080\u0082confirmed by an obviously\u00e2\u0080\u0082unrepresentative Senate; but it has made a decision that will affect the United States till 2030, 2040, and even 2050.\n\nThe Supreme Court also struck down a New York state law that had been in place since 1913 restricting people from carrying concealed firearms. As the nation reflects on gun violence, such a reckless reversal of New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gun control law is intolerable,\u00e2\u0080\u0082noted the governor of New York. American political commentator Matthew Dowd pointed\u00e2\u0080\u0082out that the problems facing the United States today are rooted in the fragmentation of democracy. What American citizens want are a fair ruling in Roe v. Wade, a real gun reform, higher minimum wages, steeper\u00e2\u0080\u0082taxes on the super-rich, better\u00e2\u0080\u0082health care for all, and other reforms that heed popular calls.\n\n6.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0082increasingly disillusioned with American democracy\n\nAmericans\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0082pride in their democracy has dropped sharply, from 90%\u00e2\u0080\u0082in 2002 to 54%\u00e2\u0080\u0082in 2022, according to a joint Washington Post-University of Maryland survey. A\u00e2\u0080\u0082poll by the\u00e2\u0080\u0082Public Policy Institute of California\u00e2\u0080\u0082shows that\u00e2\u0080\u0082Californian\u00e2\u0080\u0082voters have widespread concern that American democracy is going\u00e2\u0080\u0082off track, with 62%\u00e2\u0080\u0082saying the country is headed in the wrong direction, 46%\u00e2\u0080\u0082pessimistic about the prospect of Americans with different political views working together to resolve differences, and 52%\u00e2\u0080\u0082dissatisfied with the current way American democracy works. According to a\u00e2\u0080\u0082Quinnipiac University poll, 67%\u00e2\u0080\u0082of respondents believe that American democracy is in danger of collapse, and 48%\u00e2\u0080\u0082think there could be another\u00e2\u0080\u0082Capitol riot in the United States. According to a\u00e2\u0080\u0082Pew Center poll, 65%\u00e2\u0080\u0082of Americans believe that the American democratic system needs major reforms, while 57%\u00e2\u0080\u0082of respondents believe the United States is no longer a model of democracy. A\u00e2\u0080\u0082UCLA study shows that the US government has been losing its ability to govern and its sense of democratic responsibility in recent years, and lacks effective measures to push forward large-scale reforms\u00e2\u0080\u0082or\u00e2\u0080\u0082address issues such as electoral justice and media fraud.\n\nIII. The United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 imposition of\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d has\u00e2\u0080\u0082caused chaos around the world\n\nIn spite of all the problems facing its own democracy, the United States refuses to\u00e2\u0080\u0082reflect on itself, but instead continues to export American democratic values to other countries,\u00e2\u0080\u0082and use the pretext of democracy to oppress other countries and serve its own agenda. What the US has done is exacerbating division in the international community and bloc-based confrontation.\n\n1. Foreign policy held hostage by political polarization\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPolitics stops at the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a popular proverb in American political circles, which means that partisan struggle should be confined to domestic politics and that a united front should be formed when dealing with\u00e2\u0080\u0082foreign affairs. However, with the intensification of political polarization, Democrats and Republicans are increasingly divided on major foreign affairs\u00e2\u0080\u0082issues, and America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0082foreign policy has become more and more \u00e2\u0080\u009cextreme\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolitics crossing the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge\u00e2\u0080\u009d has become the norm. It is not only harmful to many developing countries, but also poses a threat to America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own allies.\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, the Trump administration and some extreme politicians have concocted all kinds of lies and rumors against China on coronavirus origins-tracing. The most typical is in 2021, when the US intelligence agency issued the so-called origins-tracing\u00e2\u0080\u0082report, which, in total disregard of science, fabricated the \u00e2\u0080\u009clab leak\u00e2\u0080\u009d story\u00e2\u0080\u0082and claimed that China lacked transparency and obstructed international investigations. Tracing the origins of the coronavirus is a matter of science, but\u00e2\u0080\u0082the true purpose of the US\u00e2\u0080\u0099 doing is to obscure the views of the public and manipulate the issue to shift the blame onto\u00e2\u0080\u0082China and suppress and contain China. This fully exposes the hypocrisy of American democracy and the ill effects\u00e2\u0080\u0082of political polarization.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, the US ended 20 years of war in Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0082with a hasty withdrawal of troops. It just walked away, after shattering\u00e2\u0080\u0082a whole country\u00e2\u0080\u0082and\u00e2\u0080\u0082destroying\u00e2\u0080\u0082the future of several generations. Although its troops have left, the US government continued to\u00e2\u0080\u0082sanction\u00e2\u0080\u0082Afghanistan, and illegally froze the assets of the Afghan central bank, making life even worse for the local people.\u00e2\u0080\u0082A\u00e2\u0080\u0082UN-backed report published in May 2022 showed\u00e2\u0080\u0082that nearly 20 million people in Afghanistan were facing acute hunger. Even after the devastating earthquake in Afghanistan in June 2022, the US still refused to lift the sanctions.\n\nPolitical polarization in the US is spilling over. According to a report released by the University of Ottawa,\u00e2\u0080\u0082there is open support from conservative media, including Fox News, and conservative politicians in the US for the far-right extremists in Canada. It represents a greater threat to Canadian democracy than the actions of any other state, and the implications of democratic backsliding in the US for\u00e2\u0080\u0082Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0082must be reflected upon. Professor Gordon Laxer at the University of Alberta believes the forces moving the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082toward autocracy already exist. It is ingrained among Canadians that the US is their greatest friend and will always champion democracy.\u00e2\u0080\u0082That can no longer be taken for granted.\n\n2.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Inciting confrontation and conflict\u00e2\u0080\u0082in the name of democracy\n\nDemocracy is a common value of\u00e2\u0080\u0082humanity and must not be used as a tool to advance geopolitical agenda\u00e2\u0080\u0082or counter human development and progress. However, in order to maintain its hegemony, the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082has long been monopolizing the definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d,\u00e2\u0080\u0082instigating division and confrontation\u00e2\u0080\u0082in the name of democracy, and undermining the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law.\n\nSince its outbreak in early 2022, the Ukraine crisis\u00e2\u0080\u0082has hit the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy and the livelihood of its people hard. In October 2022, the World Bank released a report suggesting that Ukraine would need at least US$349 billion, or 1.5 times the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total economic output for the whole year of 2021,\u00e2\u0080\u0082to rebuild after the war.\u00e2\u0080\u0082The US saw the Ukraine crisis as a\u00e2\u0080\u0082lucrative opportunity. Instead of taking any measures conducive to ending hostilities, the US kept fueling the flames and made a huge fortune from the war business including the arms industry and the energy sector. It described its arms supply to Ukraine as a move to support \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy versus authoritarianism\u00e2\u0080\u009d. A July 2022\u00e2\u0080\u0082report by\u00e2\u0080\u0082Serbia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Center for Strategic Prognosis pointed out that the US saw Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1999 attack on Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, as a crime, but called a similar American operation in Fallujah, an Iraqi city about the size of Grozny, liberation. America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so-called democracy has long been hijacked by interest groups and capital, and brought instability and chaos to the world.\n\nIn August 2022, then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a provocative visit to China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Taiwan region\u00e2\u0080\u0082in disregard of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm opposition and serious representations. It was a major political provocation that upgraded official contact between the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082and Taiwan, and aggravated tensions across the Taiwan Strait. Yet, Pelosi argued that the visit \u00e2\u0080\u009chonors America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vibrant democracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The crux of Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provocative visit is not about democracy, but China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US action was by no means defending or preserving democracy, but challenging and violating China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fallacy was unbearable even to some US politicians. Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Greene challenged Pelosi, saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmericans have had enough with a woman obsessed with her own power she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s held for decades while our entire country crumbles ... Enough of this fake \u00e2\u0080\u0098courage\u00e2\u0080\u0099 defending democracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe international community is seeing the US approach more and more clearly. Dmitry Medvedev,\u00e2\u0080\u0082Deputy Chairman\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, wrote that the US, as a self-proclaimed \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh priest\u00e2\u0080\u009d, has wreaked havoc around the world under the disguise of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue democracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and used money, allies and high-end weapons to crudely impose its will. An article published on Ahram Online, an Egyptian news website, argued that \u00e2\u0080\u009cliberalism\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d had been turned into\u00e2\u0080\u0082a weaponized ideology that the US uses to destabilize other countries, delegitimize their governments, and intervene with forms of sociopolitical engineering that often backfires in drastic ways. None of it has to do with the liberalism, democracy and freedom the US claims to promote.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Chairman of the Indonesian People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Wave Party\u00e2\u0080\u0082Anis Matta\u00e2\u0080\u0082pointed out that American cleverness is making other countries a battlefield. Anti-China sentiment and polarization in Indonesia are also America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. Muslims must understand that.\n\n3.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Doubling down on unilateral sanctions\n\nUnder the pretext of human rights and democracy, the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082has long been using unilateral sanctions and \u00e2\u0080\u009clong-arm jurisdiction\u00e2\u0080\u009d against other countries based on its domestic laws and its own values. In the past decades, the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082imposed unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction on Cuba, Belarus, Syria, Zimbabwe and other countries, placed maximum pressure on countries including the DPRK, Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0082and Venezuela, and unilaterally froze US$130 million in military aid to Egypt under the excuse of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of progress in human rights.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Such actions have seriously damaged the economic development and people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s livelihood in the countries\u00e2\u0080\u0082concerned, and jeopardized\u00e2\u0080\u0082the right to life, the right to self-determination\u00e2\u0080\u0082and the right to development, constituting\u00e2\u0080\u0082a continual, systematic and massive violation of human rights in other countries. In recent years, US unilateral sanctions\u00e2\u0080\u0082have been increasing and its \u00e2\u0080\u009clong arm\u00e2\u0080\u009d has been extending\u00e2\u0080\u0082further. In order to preserve its hegemony, the US has wilfully\u00e2\u0080\u0082harmed the interests of other countries, especially the legitimate and lawful interests of developing countries, in disregard of international law and the basic norms of international relations.\n\nAn article published by the Turkish Anadolu News Agency in March 2022 argued that in the name of promoting democracy, the US invaded Iraq on unsubstantiated grounds and brought immense sufferings to the local population. First, the abuse of sanctions aggravated livelihood\u00e2\u0080\u0082challenges. Between 1990 and 2003, the severe economic sanctions by the US took a heavy toll on the local economy and the well-being of the Iraqi people. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization,\u00e2\u0080\u0082the hunger rate in Iraq reached a very high level as a result of the US sanctions and embargo. Between 1990 and 1995 alone, 500,000 Iraqi children died of hunger and poor living conditions. Second, the incessant\u00e2\u0080\u0082war caused enormous civilian casualties. According to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, about 120,000 Iraqi civilians were killed between 2003, when the US started the Iraq War,\u00e2\u0080\u0082and 2011, when the US announced its withdrawal. Third, the\u00e2\u0080\u0082imposed political model failed to adapt. The US forced the American-style democracy upon Iraq in disregard\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the latter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national conditions, only to aggravate the political fight between different factions in the country.\n\nThe unilateral sanctions imposed by the US fully demonstrate its arrogance and indifference toward humanitarianism. On 11 February\u00e2\u0080\u00822022, President Biden signed an executive order to split in half the US$7 billion in Afghan central bank\u00e2\u0080\u0082assets frozen in the US. Half of the assets were to fund financial compensations for 9/11 victims, and the other half were transferred to an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Such blatant stealing from the Afghan people has been widely condemned by the international community. SINDOnews.com, a news website of Indonesia, reported in March 2022 that people of Afghan descent rallied at the US Embassy in Jakarta to protest the US government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looting of\u00e2\u0080\u0082assets\u00e2\u0080\u0082from the Afghan government. The indignant protesters argued that the assets of the former Afghan government belonged to the Afghan people\u00e2\u0080\u0082and should be used to aid the Afghan people who were experiencing an economic crisis.\n\n4. Undermining democracy in international relations\n\nInternational affairs bear on the\u00e2\u0080\u0082common interests of mankind, and should be conducted through consultation by all countries. Yet,\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US has never truly observed the principle of democracy in international relations. Under the pretext of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmultilateralism\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082and \u00e2\u0080\u009cinternational rules\u00e2\u0080\u009d,\u00e2\u0080\u0082and clinging to the\u00e2\u0080\u0082Cold War mentality, the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082has exercised fake multilateralism and bloc politics, instigated\u00e2\u0080\u0082division and antagonism, created\u00e2\u0080\u0082bloc confrontation, and practiced unilateralism in the name of multilateralism. Its hegemonic, domineering and bullying acts seriously impede the development of true multilateralism.\n\nThe US\u00e2\u0080\u0082places its domestic law above international law, and adopts a selective approach to international rules, applying and discarding such rules as it sees fit. Since the 1980s, the US has withdrawn from 17 important international organizations or agreements, including the UN Human Rights Council, WHO, UNESCO, the Paris Agreement on climate change, the JCPOA, the Arms Trade Treaty, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty\u00e2\u0080\u0082and the Treaty on Open Skies.\n\nThe US flagrantly violates the purposes\u00e2\u0080\u0082and principles of the UN Charter and the basic norms governing international relations, waging wars and creating division and conflict\u00e2\u0080\u0082across the world. Throughout its history\u00e2\u0080\u0082of 240-plus years, the US has been at peace for only 16 years\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is indeed the most belligerent country in world history. Since the end of World War II, the US has waged or participated in many wars overseas, including the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War, which caused immense\u00e2\u0080\u0082civilian casualties and property losses\u00e2\u0080\u0082as well as\u00e2\u0080\u0082humanitarian catastrophes. Since 2001, the wars and military operations that the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082launched in the name of fighting terrorism have killed more than 900,000 people, including some 335,000 civilians, injured millions and displaced tens of millions.\n\nPaying no heed to the\u00e2\u0080\u0082United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\u00e2\u0080\u0082and\u00e2\u0080\u0082principles of international law, or to\u00e2\u0080\u0082the democratic rights\u00e2\u0080\u0082of\u00e2\u0080\u0082Asia-Pacific countries\u00e2\u0080\u0082and Pacific island countries in regional and international affairs,\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US has emboldened\u00e2\u0080\u0082Japan by expressly supporting its decision to discharge the nuclear waste water from Fukushima, even though\u00e2\u0080\u0082the government of Japan has not yet fully consulted\u00e2\u0080\u0082stakeholders and relevant international agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0082on the disposal,\u00e2\u0080\u0082not yet provided sufficient scientific and factual grounds for its behavior, and\u00e2\u0080\u0082not yet addressed\u00e2\u0080\u0082the legitimate concerns\u00e2\u0080\u0082of the international community. On the other hand, the US administration, citing \u00e2\u0080\u009cradionuclide contamination\u00e2\u0080\u009d,\u00e2\u0080\u0082banned the import of Japanese food and agricultural products from\u00e2\u0080\u0082areas around Fukushima, exposing the hypocrisy of typical US-style double standards.\n\nAdvancing\u00e2\u0080\u0082the Cold War mentality in the South Pacific region, the \u00e2\u0080\u0082US has ganged up\u00e2\u0080\u0082with the UK\u00e2\u0080\u0082and Australia to put\u00e2\u0080\u0082together AUKUS, a racist clique, and pledged to help Australia build at least eight nuclear submarines together with the\u00e2\u0080\u0082UK. The move constitutes a serious violation of the principles of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\u00e2\u0080\u0082and the\u00e2\u0080\u0082South Pacific Nuclear\u00e2\u0080\u0082Free Zone\u00e2\u0080\u0082Treaty, treading a reckless line on the brink of nuclear proliferation\u00e2\u0080\u0082and creating tremendous risks.\u00e2\u0080\u0082It has also opened\u00e2\u0080\u0082the\u00e2\u0080\u0082Pandora\u00e2\u0080\u0099s box\u00e2\u0080\u0082of regional arms race, casting a shadow over regional peace, security and stability.\n\nPrior to\u00e2\u0080\u0082the ninth Summit of the Americas\u00e2\u0080\u0082in June 2022, Julio Yao, a Panamanian expert on international issues, wrote in local media that today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s US is an absolute\u00e2\u0080\u0082renegade\u00e2\u0080\u0082of\u00e2\u0080\u0082international law, and the most genuinely authentic personification of the use of brute force in international relations. The US\u00e2\u0080\u0082is the only country that has not signed or ratified any\u00e2\u0080\u0082human rights treaty,\u00e2\u0080\u0082and is not a party to the\u00e2\u0080\u0082United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It\u00e2\u0080\u0082is the only country that does not ban secret biological weapons, with more than 200 laboratories outside its borders. The only thing that the US intends to do with the Summit of the Americas is to involve\u00e2\u0080\u0082Latin America\u00e2\u0080\u0082and the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u0082in\u00e2\u0080\u0082the war in Ukraine and to divide and weaken them.\n\nIn August 2022, a\u00e2\u0080\u0082South China Morning Post\u00e2\u0080\u0082article\u00e2\u0080\u0082noted that the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracies\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the US and the West have been relentlessly chipping away at the foundations of international rules and exploiting them when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convenient. While the US and the West denounce Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvasion\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Ukraine, they forget their serial interventions, subversions and interference across the globe. What the US did has smashed up the world economy, thereby exposing more middle-income countries to debt crises. When the big powers are selective in following the rules they wrote, the whole system loses credibility.\n\n5. Foisting a trumped-up narrative of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy versus authoritarianism\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nHarboring the Cold War mentality, a hegemonic logic and a preference for bloc politics, the US administration has framed a narrative of \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy versus authoritarianism\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and labeled countries as \u00e2\u0080\u009cautocracies\u00e2\u0080\u009d, with a view to using ideology and values as a tool to suppress other countries and advance its own geostrategy\u00e2\u0080\u0082under the disguise of democracy.\n\nIn 2021, the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082held\u00e2\u0080\u0082the first\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u009cSummit for Democracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d, attempting to divide the international community into so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocratic and undemocratic camps\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082by openly drawing an ideological line. The move drew\u00e2\u0080\u0082questions\u00e2\u0080\u0082extensively, including\u00e2\u0080\u0082from within\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US. Both Foreign Affairs\u00e2\u0080\u0082and The Diplomat\u00e2\u0080\u0082carried articles\u00e2\u0080\u0082criticizing the summit as chasing\u00e2\u0080\u0082the wrong goal, not only failing to achieve unity among democratic countries, but also drawing criticism for the representation issue. The US\u00e2\u0080\u0082has long lacked a set goal in its promotion of democracy around the world, and has been slow in following up its\u00e2\u0080\u0082rhetoric. When\u00e2\u0080\u0082democracy in the US is in such a mess, holding a democracy summit cannot boost democracy around the world, but more\u00e2\u0080\u0082likely create a greater geopolitical crisis. Hitoshi Tanaka, Chairman of the Institute for International Strategy of Japan, pointed out that the US has been imposing \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082on other countries, advancing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy versus authoritarianism\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0082campaign, and expanding global division. Japan should not blindly follow suit.\n\nTo brand oneself\u00e2\u0080\u0082as democracy while\u00e2\u0080\u0082others as autocracies\u00e2\u0080\u0082is in itself an act contrary to democracy. The so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocracy versus authoritarianism\u00e2\u0080\u009d narrative does not reflect the realities of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world, nor is it in line with the trend of the times. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBelarus\u00e2\u0080\u00821\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a\u00e2\u0080\u0082state television\u00e2\u0080\u0082station of Belarus,\u00e2\u0080\u0082commented that\u00e2\u0080\u0082the list\u00e2\u0080\u0082of participants\u00e2\u0080\u0082to the summit was clearly based on the US standard of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreedom\u00e2\u0080\u009d,\u00e2\u0080\u0082but the question was how could\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082believe that\u00e2\u0080\u0082it could monopolize the definition and interpretation\u00e2\u0080\u0082of democracy, and tell others what democracy should look like.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Singapore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Straits Times\u00e2\u0080\u0082carried a column that said\u00e2\u0080\u0082the US must realize that American democracy has lost its former luster, and is no longer the gold standard. There is no fixed model of democracy, and the US no longer has an absolute say over what democracy means. That is the truth. The US should pragmatically reassess its diplomatic methods and focus on cooperation instead of confrontation.\n\nDespite unprecedentedly low ratings of US democracy at home and abroad, the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hysteria\u00e2\u0080\u0082to export US-style\u00e2\u0080\u0082democracy and values\u00e2\u0080\u0082continues unabated. The US\u00e2\u0080\u0082has not only cobbled together values-based alliances\u00e2\u0080\u0082such as\u00e2\u0080\u0082AUKUS, the Quad and the Five Eyes, but also\u00e2\u0080\u0082attempted\u00e2\u0080\u0082to disrupt and undermine\u00e2\u0080\u0082normal international cooperation\u00e2\u0080\u0082in economy, trade, science, technology, culture\u00e2\u0080\u0082and people-to-people exchanges by drawing ideological lines and trumpeting\u00e2\u0080\u0082the\u00e2\u0080\u0082Cold War mentality.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Al Jazeera\u00e2\u0080\u0082observed\u00e2\u0080\u0082that the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082insistence on holding a democracy summit and acting as a global democratic leader even\u00e2\u0080\u0082when trust in its own\u00e2\u0080\u0082democratic system is declining\u00e2\u0080\u0082has raised\u00e2\u0080\u0082widespread suspicion. James Goldgeier,\u00e2\u0080\u0082professor of international relations at\u00e2\u0080\u0082American University, said the US\u00e2\u0080\u0082has lost\u00e2\u0080\u0082its\u00e2\u0080\u0082credibility,\u00e2\u0080\u0082and that its administration should hold a domestic democracy summit to focus on injustice and inequality, including issues such as voting rights and disinformation. Emma Ashford, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, questioned\u00e2\u0080\u0082how can the US spread democracy or act as an example for others if it barely has a functioning democracy at home. The South China Morning Post\u00e2\u0080\u0082pointed out that the summit reflected two myths about US democracy: First, global advance of democracy\u00e2\u0080\u0082since the end of the Cold War\u00e2\u0080\u0082is backsliding and it needs the US to reverse it; second, the US is the most important democracy in the world\u00e2\u0080\u0082and its global leadership is paramount for other countries. These two myths completely ignore the democratic backsliding in the US, the rejection of the overwhelming majority of countries\u00e2\u0080\u0082to being\u00e2\u0080\u0082kidnapped by the\u00e2\u0080\u0082hypocritical \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcept of democracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the US, and the strong desire of developing countries to grow their\u00e2\u0080\u0082economies\u00e2\u0080\u0082and raise living standards.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nDemocracy is humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0082common value; however, there is no single model of political system that is applicable to all countries in the world. Human civilization, if compared to a garden, should be a diverse place in which democracy in different countries blooms like a hundred flowers.\u00e2\u0080\u0082The US\u00e2\u0080\u0082has American-style democracy, China has Chinese-style democracy, and other countries\u00e2\u0080\u0082have their\u00e2\u0080\u0082own unique models\u00e2\u0080\u0082of democracy that suit\u00e2\u0080\u0082their respective\u00e2\u0080\u0082national conditions. It should be up to the people of a country to judge whether the\u00e2\u0080\u0082country is democratic or not and how to better promote democracy\u00e2\u0080\u0082in their country. The few self-righteous countries have no right to point fingers.\n\nThose who have many flaws themselves have little credibility to lecture others. Attempts to undermine others for one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own profit and destabilize the world must be unanimously opposed. A black-and-white division of countries as democratic\u00e2\u0080\u0082or\u00e2\u0080\u0082authoritarian is both anachronistic and arbitrary. What\u00e2\u0080\u0082our world needs today is not to stoke\u00e2\u0080\u0082division in the name of democracy and\u00e2\u0080\u0082pursue de facto supremacy-oriented\u00e2\u0080\u0082unilateralism, but to strengthen solidarity and cooperation and uphold true multilateralism\u00e2\u0080\u0082on the basis of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. What\u00e2\u0080\u0082our world needs today is not\u00e2\u0080\u0082to interfere in other countries\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0082internal affairs under the guise of democracy, but to advocate genuine democracy, reject\u00e2\u0080\u0082pseudo-democracy and jointly promote\u00e2\u0080\u0082greater democracy in international relations. What\u00e2\u0080\u0082our world needs today is not a \u00e2\u0080\u009cSummit for Democracy\u00e2\u0080\u009d that hypes up\u00e2\u0080\u0082confrontation and contributes nothing to the collective response to global challenges, but a conference of solidarity that focuses on taking real actions to solve prominent global challenges.\n\nFreedom, democracy and human rights are the common pursuit of humanity,\u00e2\u0080\u0082and values that the Communist Party of China\u00e2\u0080\u0082(CPC) always pursues. China commits\u00e2\u0080\u0082to and advances\u00e2\u0080\u0082whole-process\u00e2\u0080\u0082people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s democracy, and\u00e2\u0080\u0082puts into action the principle of people running the\u00e2\u0080\u0082country in the CPC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exercise of national governance in specific and concrete ways. China\u00e2\u0080\u0082stands ready\u00e2\u0080\u0082to strengthen exchanges and mutual learning with other countries on the issue of democracy, advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0082humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, promote greater democracy in international relations, and make new and greater contributions to\u00e2\u0080\u0082human progress.\n\n", "id": "f14544ebe3ca3b74b58d197f972df3aa"}

{"date": "2022-08-09", "title": "Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu on Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Visit to Taiwan", "content": "On 9 August 2022, Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu took questions from China Central Television and China Global Television Network on Nancy Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit to Taiwan.\n\nQ1. Over the past few days, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit to Taiwan has caused strong public outrage in China. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your take on this?\n\nMa: This is just a political farce, and a dangerous, malicious provocation. Speaker Pelosi made this provocative visit in disregard of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warning. The visit infringed on China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sovereignty and territorial integrity; violated the one-China principle and provisions in the three China-US joint communiqu\u00c3\u00a9s; affected the political foundation of China-US relations; and undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It is unacceptable to the Chinese people. China has every reason to respond with countermeasures. The incident is also a lesson, revealing to the world US motives to contain China with Taiwan and the intention of the Taiwan authorities to seek American support for independence. In its aftermath, the one-China consensus of the international community emerged stronger, and the US attempt to play the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaiwan card\u00e2\u0080\u009d and contain China proved more unpopular and futile.\n\nQ2. The US claims that there is no change to its one-China policy and that Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit does not violate the one-China policy. How would you respond to that?\n\nMa: The one-China principle is the consensus of the international community. It is also the political foundation on which China develops relations with other countries. It is a red line that must not be crossed. What does one China mean? There can only be one answer. That is, there is but one China in the world, Taiwan is part of China, and the Government of the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. This is a basic norm of international relations confirmed by UNGA Resolution 2758. It is a commitment made by the US in the three China-US joint communiqu\u00c3\u00a9s. The principle, written down in black and white, is crystal clear. There is no room for ambiguity or arbitrary interpretation.\n\nThe US claims that there is no change in its one-China policy. But in fact, it has been undermining the one-China principle over the years. It has put into its one-China policy some unilateral stuff, including the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaiwan Relations Act\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSix Assurances\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This is against international law. China never accepts it, and is always opposed to it.\n\nThe US also claims that Pelosi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visit does not violate the one-China policy. The three joint communiqu\u00c3\u00a9s provide that the US can only maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations with Taiwan. The executive, legislative and judicial branches are all part of the US Government. Pelosi is the number three figure in the US Government. During her stay in Taiwan, she was speaking on behalf of the US from the beginning to the end. Even she herself admits that it is an official visit. If this is not official engagement, then what is it?\n\nQ3. The US claims that the change to the status quo that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prevailed with regard to Taiwan for more than 40 years is coming from Beijing, not from the US. What is your view on this?\n\nMa: So what is the status quo of the Taiwan Strait? The status quo is that both sides of the Strait belong to one and the same China, Taiwan is part of China, and neither China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sovereignty nor its territorial integrity is ever divided. It is not China who is changing the status quo, but the US and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaiwan independence\u00e2\u0080\u009d separatist forces.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nOver the years, the US has been colluding with the Taiwan authorities, and elevating its substantive relations with Taiwan. It has sold large amounts of weapons to Taiwan, helped it develop so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009casymmetric capabilities\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and emboldened the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaiwan independence\u00e2\u0080\u009d separatist forces. If these are not changing the status quo, what are they?\n\nRefusing to recognize the 1992 Consensus, the DPP authorities have insisted on pushing for \u00e2\u0080\u009cincremental independence\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and redoubled efforts to remove the Chinese identity of Taiwan. If these are not changing the status quo, what are they?\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nChina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s countermeasures are a necessary and legitimate response to the provocations by the US and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaiwan independence\u00e2\u0080\u009d forces. They are just and lawful.\n\nQ4. The US says it will not seek and does not want a crisis, and China should take full responsibility for the current escalation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait. What is your take on this?\n\nMa: This is confounding black and white. The crisis is unilaterally provoked by the US. Despite China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many representations, the US still allowed Pelosi to visit Taiwan. Faced with this, China has no choice but to fight back and defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The responsibility and consequence of the current tensions have to be borne by the US and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaiwan independence\u00e2\u0080\u009d separatist forces.\n\nQ5. The US claims that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military exercise and crossing of the median line of the Taiwan Strait are overreaction that has escalated the situation and threatened regional peace and stability. What is your take?\n\nMa: It is the US that is threatening peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is part of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s territory. There is no such thing as a median line in the Strait. The Chinese armed forces conduct military exercises in waters off China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Taiwan island to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity of China. Our measures are open and proportionate. They are in line with both domestic law and international law and practices. They are beyond reproach.\n\nThe US and its allies often come to the adjacent waters of China, flexing muscles and stirring up troubles. They conduct up to a hundred military exercises each year. They, instead of someone else, are the ones that overreact and escalate the situation.\n\nQ6. The US claims that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to suspend cooperation with the US in multiple areas does not punish Washington but the whole world. What is you comment?\n\nMa: The US cannot represent the whole world. China has warned the US well in advance that should Pelosi visit Taiwan, it would cause a crisis and major disruptions to China-US exchange and cooperation. Unfortunately, the US side ignored that, and went ahead with the visit. The Taiwan question is at the very heart of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core interests. The United States, while undermining China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core interests, is asking for China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooperation where they need it. What kind of logic is this? China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to cancel or suspend cooperation in some areas does not come without warning. We say what we mean and mean what we say. There is no reason why the US should feel surprised or upset.\n\nLet me stress this: as a responsible major country, China will, as always, take an active part in international cooperation on climate change and other matters. We make our own contribution to the tackling of global challenges. What the US should do is to fulfill its international responsibilities and obligations. It should stop making excuses for its own mistakes.\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\nQ7. Some in the US compare China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military drills in the Taiwan Strait to Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvasion of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which they claim will be denounced by the international community. What is your comment on that?\n\nMa: Such a claim is ill-intentioned. The Taiwan question is entirely China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal affair. It is different from the Ukraine issue. The US always stokes tension and provokes troubles. Preliminary numbers show that between the end of the Second World War and 2001, there were 248 armed conflicts in 153 regions across the world, among which 201 were initiated by the US. Since 2001, wars and military operations launched by the US have resulted in over 800,000 deaths and tens of millions displaced from home. After starting so many wars and killing so many civilians to preserve its hegemony, the US is now creating troubles in the Taiwan Strait. How could we possibly allow this to happen?\n\nQ8. A few days ago, the G7 foreign ministers issued a statement regarding Taiwan with negative language, expressing so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cconcern\u00e2\u0080\u009d over China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions. Meanwhile we see an increasing number of countries and international organizations speaking out in support of China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s justified measures. What is your take?\n\nMa: More than 170 countries and many international organizations have spoken up for what is right, reaffirming their commitment to the one-China principle and expressing support for China in defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Both the President of the UN General Assembly and the UN Secretary-General have stated that the UN will continue to adhere to UNGA Resolution 2758, the centerpiece of which is the one-China principle. Compared with over 170 countries, what do G7 think they are? Who cares what they say?\n\nQ9. The US claims that if China continues to take more countermeasures, the US will be forced to respond, which may lead to a spiral of escalation. What is your view on what may happen next?\n\nMa: It has been proved time and again that the US is the biggest troublemaker of cross-Strait peace and regional stability. If the international community allows the US to do what it wants, the UN Charter will be just a sheet of paper, and the law of the jungle will prevail. In the end, it will be the developing countries that suffer.\n\nThe Chinese people are not to be misled by fallacies or scared by evils, and will never waver in defending our core interests. We want to stress to the US: do not act recklessly, and stop going further down on the doomed path. Give up the attempt to use Taiwan to contain China, play no games but return to the one-China principle and the three joint communiqu\u00c3\u00a9s, and do right things and take concrete steps to facilitate the steady development of China-US relations.\n\n", "id": "f77f34bc64bc363b805d4f5f69e04106"}

{"date": "2022-08-05", "title": "The Chinese Delegation Attends the 10th Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons", "content": "On August 1, 2022, the 10th Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (hereinafter referred to as\u00e2\u0080\u0082the NPT) was inaugurated at the UN Headquarters in New York. Director-General of the Department of Arms Control of the Foreign Ministry Fu Cong headed the Chinese\u00e2\u0080\u0082delegation to the conference, and delivered a speech at the general debate. He expounded on China's stance on safeguarding the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime with\u00e2\u0080\u0082the NPT\u00e2\u0080\u0082as the cornerstone.\n\n\n\nFu Cong said we are living\u00e2\u0080\u0082in a world where profound changes and the COVID-19 pandemic, both unseen in a century, are intertwined. The specter of Cold War mentality hangs on, and the outdated approach to security based on military alliances has resurfaced. Driven by the obsession with the so-called major-power strategic competition, the global strategic security environment continues to deteriorate, and risks of arms race and conflicts are growing. As a result, the international non-proliferation regime represented by the NPT is significantly strained and even faces new and the most severe challenges since the end of the Cold War. China advocates taking\u00e2\u0080\u0082this Review Conference as an opportunity to promote the three pillars of nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear energy in a balanced manner, so as to breathe new life into the NPT in promoting world peace and development. To this end, China proposes the following:\n\nFirst, we need to uphold the concept of common security in advancing international nuclear disarmament. China is firmly committed to the path of peaceful development and a nuclear strategy of self-defense, and undertakes not to be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. While firmly safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, China always keeps its nuclear capability at the minimum level required for safeguarding national security. China's nuclear policy, marked by\u00e2\u0080\u0082a high level of stability, consistency and predictability, is in itself\u00e2\u0080\u0082an important contribution to the international nuclear disarmament endeavor. The principles of \"maintaining global strategic stability\" and \"undiminished security for all\" should be followed in the practices of nuclear disarmament. Countries with the largest nuclear arsenals should further conduct significant and substantive reduction of their nuclear arsenals in a verifiable, irreversible and legally binding manner. This will create conditions for other nuclear-weapon states to join the nuclear disarmament process. Nuclear-weapon states need to work together to reduce nuclear risks. On January 3 this year, leaders of China, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom and France issued a Joint Statement, stressing that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought, and reaffirming that none of their nuclear weapons are targeted at each other or at any other state. On that basis, the five nuclear-weapon states need to further conduct in-depth dialogue on reducing the role of nuclear weapons in their national security doctrines and other issues.\n\nSecond, we need to adhere to the direction of political settlement in addressing the challenges of nuclear-proliferation. All parties concerned should stay committed to bringing the JCPOA back on track at an early date through diplomatic negotiations. The United States\u00e2\u0080\u0082should completely lift its relevant illegal sanctions on Iran and long-arm jurisdiction measures on third parties. On that basis, Iran should return to full compliance with its nuclear commitments. We\u00e2\u0080\u0082should reject double standards in the area of non-proliferation. The nuclear-powered submarine cooperation among the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia poses severe nuclear proliferation risks, in contravention of the object and purpose of the NPT. The review conference should conduct in-depth discussions on its implications in all aspects in order to\u00e2\u0080\u0082firmly uphold the international non-proliferation regime. We need to follow the dual track approach and the principle of phased and synchronized actions in advancing the process towards the establishment of a peace mechanism and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. The so-called nuclear sharing arrangements run counter to the provisions of the NPT and increase the risks of nuclear proliferation and nuclear conflicts. The United States should withdraw all its nuclear weapons from Europe and refrain from deploying nuclear weapons in any other region. Any attempt to replicate the NATO's nuclear sharing model in the Asia-Pacific region would undermine regional strategic stability and would be firmly opposed by countries in the region and, when necessary, face severe countermeasures. Nuclear-weapon states should sign and ratify all the relevant protocols to the nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties as early as possible, including the Central Asia Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons. China is willing to take the lead in signing the Protocol to the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone.\n\nThird, we need to commit to the fundamental goal of common development and promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The international community should support the IAEA in playing a central role, increase funding and technological support for developing countries, and fully unleash the potential of nuclear energy and nuclear technology. We must take a balanced approach towards non-proliferation and peaceful use. Some countries seek to create divisions along ideological lines, stretch the concept of national security, and abuse multilateral export control regime, all in the name of non-proliferation. We must resolutely reject such practices. The peaceful use of nuclear energy should not come at the expense of the environment and human health. The Japanese government should seriously respond to the legitimate concerns of neighboring\u00e2\u0080\u0082countries and the international community at large regarding the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident, and fully consult with the stakeholders and the relevant international agencies, in order to find an appropriate solution to the disposal of the nuclear-contaminated water.\n\n\n\nFinally, Fu Cong emphasized that this April, President Xi Jinping proposed a Global Security Initiative at the opening ceremony of the Annual Conference of the Boao Forum for Asia. This initiative highlights the necessity to stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, give due regard to the legitimate security concerns of all countries, uphold the principle of indivisible security, and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture.\u00e2\u0080\u0082Guided by this initiative, China is ready to join hands with all countries to continuously strengthen the universality, authority and effectiveness of the NPT, add more stability and certainty to this era of turbulence and transformation, and make new contributions\u00e2\u0080\u0082to world peace, stability and prosperity.\n\nSince the NPT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entry into force in 1970, a review conference has been held every five years to review the implementation of the Treaty in nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear energy, and to plan for global governance agenda\u00e2\u0080\u0082in the next stage\u00e2\u0080\u0082in the field of nuclear energy. This year's review conference was originally set for 2020, but was postponed to this year because of the pandemic. The conference will last until August 26.\n\n", "id": "fc5d68e419b838af8eb15fff7e7c27ec"}
{"date": "2022-09-08", "title": "Late-night Phone Call, Quick Action, and Deep Brotherhood", "content": "\n\nOn September 8, 2022, Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Liu Jinsong attended and addressed the second China-Pakistan Think Tank Forum online. The Forum was co-hosted by the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad of Pakistan and the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. His speech went as follows:\n\nOver the past year, China-Pakistan relations have stood various tests, and our friendship remains rock-solid. Three things impressed me most:\n\nFirst, China made all-out efforts to help Pakistan after it was hit by the floods. Since June this year, Pakistan has been stricken by the worst flood disaster in decades, which has caused 1,000 plus deaths and affected over 33 million people. Satellite images showed that one-eighth of Pakistan was flooded. Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan His Excellency Nong Rong told me that when he accompanied Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visiting the disaster areas on the plane, he saw the vast rural areas in Sindh Province flooded as an ocean. I also learned from the TV news that in disaster-stricken areas, heavy rains and floods have destroyed bridges and roads, interrupted traffic, inundated farmland, swept away houses, and displaced people from home and students from schools. The Chinese people, deeply understand what the Pakistani people have suffered, are worried and in sorrow. And facing the floods, the Pakistani people stayed united saving themselves and quickly began to rebuild their homes, demonstrating their indomitable national character. Such scenes are admirable.\n\nChina and Pakistan are ironclad brothers with a long tradition of helping and supporting each other. We will never forget that in the wake of the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, Pakistan took out all tents in its stock and promptly sent them to the disaster-hit areas in China by military aircraft. As a Chinese saying goes, \"Receiving drips of water when in need, and I shall return the kindness with a spring\", we see the current difficulties faced by Pakistan, our ironclad brothers, as our own difficulties. President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have sent messages of condolence to President Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, respectively. Under the social and livelihood cooperation framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), China has provided 4,000 tents, 50,000 blankets and 50,000 pieces of waterproof tarp to Pakistan. They have been delivered to the frontline of disaster relief.\n\nOn the late night of August 22, when Pakistani Ambassador to China H.E. Mr. Moin ul Haque contacted me and asked for emergency assistance from China, we took action in the early morning to fully support Pakistan's fight against floods. After emergency coordination by the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA), China provided 100-million-yuan emergency humanitarian assistance for Pakistan. The first batch of 3,000 tents out of 25,000 tents was shipped to Pakistan from Sichuan by military aircraft at the end of August and was put into use in the disaster-hit areas. In light of the development of the disaster, the CIDCA has provided additional 300-million-yuan emergency humanitarian assistance. Efforts to provide other urgently-needed materials such as vegetables and tents are underway.\n\nThe Chinese people also actively lent a helping hand. A few hours after the Pakistani Embassy in China opened a dedicated bank account for Prime Minister's Flood Relief Fund 2022, it received a combined donation of one million yuan. A schoolboy named Luan Mingxuan in Beijing donated all his pocket money. Chinese non-governmental rescue teams spontaneously headed to Pakistan for disaster relief, and Chinese enterprises in Pakistan took the initiative to repair roads and bridges in the affected areas. Recently, Prime Minister Shehbaz also expressed condolences over the casualties caused by the earthquake in Luding, Sichuan Province. A ruthless flood disaster can bring out the best of humanity. The friendship between China and Pakistan, which is higher than mountains, deeper than sea and sweeter than honey, has been verified again. As a Chinese saying goes, \"If brothers are firmly united, they could be like a knife that can cut through metal\", I believe that our Pakistani brothers will be able to prevail over the disaster and rebuild their homes.\n\nSecond, the CPEC is effectively supporting Pakistan's economic development and social stability. Not long ago, the Karot Hydropower Plant project, the first of its kind under the CPEC, was completed and put into operation after seven years of construction, bringing thousands of job opportunities to the local people. With an average annual energy output of about 3.2 billion kWh, the plant will provide cheap and clean energy for 5 million local households. It is estimated that the annual carbon dioxide emission can be reduced by 3.5 million tons, which will effectively help Pakistan improve its energy security and promote green transformation.\n\nNow, the CPEC has entered the stage of high-quality development. Prime Minister Shehbaz, attaching great importance to the construction of the CPEC, has visited the Gwadar Port twice and held a symposium for Chinese-funded enterprises, during which he coordinated and responded to the demands of enterprises. Investment promotion for the Rashakai Special Economic Zone is progressing smoothly, and solid steps are being taken to advance cooperation in industries, agriculture, society and people's livelihood, thus making sustained and new contributions to Pakistan's industrialization and modernization.\n\nThird, Pakistan firmly supports the Chinese side on issues concerning China's core interests such as Taiwan and Xinjiang. Last month, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi paid a sneaky visit to China's Taiwan region. It seriously violated China's sovereignty, interfered in China's internal affairs and jeopardized peace across the Taiwan Strait. The Pakistani government, parliament and people from all political parties have come forward without hesitation, to reaffirm their commitment to the one-China principle, and together with more than 100 countries in the world, to speak out for justice. Regarding the recently released so-called Xinjiang-related assessment by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spoke up for China at the earliest opportunity, offering China invaluable support on Xinjiang-related issues. I grew up in Xinjiang. Of all people, the people in Xinjiang, whatever their ethnic backgrounds, are in the best position to tell the world what the human rights conditions are like in Xinjiang. Anyone who has been to Xinjiang says that Xinjiang is a nice place. Over the past five years, there has not been any terrorist incident in Xinjiang. This summer, Xinjiang was the most popular destination for domestic tourists, and rumors spread by the United States and other Western countries fell apart.\n\nUnder the intertwined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine crisis and the beggar-thy-neighbor financial policies of some developed countries, issues related to the security of food, energy, finance, industrial and supply chains and ecology have become increasingly prominent. Many Asian countries encounter rising food prices, shortage of chemical fertilizers and climbing energy prices. Some Asian countries have seen continued depreciation of their currencies, declining foreign reserves and high inflation. The rising financial risks have been transmitted to the people's livelihood, causing political turmoil in some countries. Some western countries attempted to build \"a small yard with high fences\" and decouple with others. As a result, the regional industrial and supply chains are at risk of breaking. Against this backdrop, as all-weather strategic cooperative partners, China and Pakistan need to make efforts in the following aspects:\n\n- Strengthen solidarity, cooperation and mutual support. The two sides should maintain the tradition of high-level exchanges, firmly support each other in safeguarding respective core interests, and be solid strategic support for each other. China is ready to share its experience in state governance with Pakistan and fully support Pakistan's disaster relief and post-disaster reconstruction.\n\n- Jointly pursue high-quality CPEC cooperation. The two sides should make joint efforts to strengthen industrial cooperation and forge secure and stable industrial and supply chains; step up cooperation on law enforcement and security to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Pakistan; and jointly share \"CPEC stories\" to let lies and rumors fall apart.\n\n- Take the lead in implementing the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI). The two sides should strengthen cooperation in poverty alleviation, food security, pandemic response and vaccine, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy, connectivity and other fields, and should take the lead in implementing the 32 deliverables of the High-level Dialogue on Global Development. It's important to implement the GSI, stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, act on true multilateralism, and contribute our strengths to maintaining peace and tranquility in the region and the world at large. An old Chinese saying goes, \"Faith will move a mountain\". The founding father of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah once said that \"We are not afraid of the deep sea or the fire, because we believe in the sun and the future.\" I am convinced that with the joint efforts of friends from all walks of life in both countries, including scholars from think-tanks, China-Pakistan relations will surely usher in a brighter future!\n\n*\u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082*\u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 \u00e2\u0080\u0082 *\n\nActing Director of the China Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan Bilal Akram Shah expressed condolences to the victims of the earthquake on Sept. 5 in Luding, China's Sichuan province, and extended sympathy to the bereaved families and the injured. Bilal spoke highly of China-Pakistan relations, and expressed sincere gratitude for China's much-needed support for Pakistan in fighting floods and disaster relief. Bilal said, Pakistan appreciates the GSI and the GDI, both proposed by President Xi Jinping. Conflict and confrontation will not bring benefits to any country. Instead, cooperation and development are the mainstream of the times. Pakistan is ready to continue to work with China to deepen the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries, and promote Belt and Road cooperation, especially the high-quality CPEC cooperation, so as to make positive contributions to regional peace and stability.\n\n", "id": "fcf3a414e56c375e84a8026d9bd5973b"}

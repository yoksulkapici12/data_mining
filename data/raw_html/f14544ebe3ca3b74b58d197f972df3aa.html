The maladies afflictingâAmerican democracy deeply infectedâthe cells ofâUSâpolitics and society, and further revealedâUSâgovernance failure andâinstitutional defects.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Despite mountingâproblems at home, theâUSâcontinued to behave with a sense of superiority, point fingers at others, usurp the role of a âlecturer of democracyâ,âand concoct and play up the falseânarrative of âdemocracy versus authoritarianismâ. To serve the interests of none other than itself, the US acted to split the world into two camps of what it defined as âdemocracies and non-democraciesâ, and organized another edition of theâso-called âSummit for Democracyâ to check how various countries had performed on meeting US standards for democracy and to issue new orders. Be it high-sounding rhetoric or maneuvers driven by hidden agenda,ânone can hide the real designs of the US â to maintain its hegemony by playing bloc politics and using democracy as a tool for political ends. â</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">This report collectsâa multitude of facts, media comments andâexpert opinions to present a complete and real picture of American democracy over the year. What they reveal is an American democracy in chaos at home and a trail of havoc and disasters left behind as the US peddled and imposed its democracy around the globe. It helps remove the facade of American democracy for more people worldwide.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>II. American democracy in chronic ills</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The US refuses to acknowledge the manyâproblems andâinstitutional crisesâconfronting its democracy at home and stubbornly claims to be the template and beacon of democracyâfor the world. Such imperiousnessâperpetuatesâthe ills of itsâdemocracyâand causes dire consequences for other countries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>1.âAmerican democracy in further decline</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The functioning of American democratic institutions may look as lively as a circus, with politicians of all stripes showing off themselves one after another.âButâhowever boisterous the show is, it cannot hide the lethargy in addressing the long-standing, grave problems. Le Mondeâpointsâout that 2022 isâa year of doubt for US democracy. Aâsilent civil war has taken root in the US, and repairing damaged democracy requires a sense of nation and public interest,âbothâof which are currently lacking.âThisâis sad for a country that has long held itself up as a model.âIn 2022, the Swedish think tankâInternational Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance added the USâto its âlist of regressive democraciesâ.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Two years afterâtheâCapitolâriots on 6 January 2021, the US system of democracy still has difficulty in learning the lessons, as political violence continued to grow and deteriorate. <em>The Washington Postâand The New Yorker</em>âobserve that American democracy isâin a worse state than ever before, with the congressional riots fully exposingâsocial rifts, political divisions and rampant misinformation. The twoâparties, although not unaware ofâthe age-old ills of American democracy, have neither the resolve nor the courage to pursue changes, given the increasingly polarized political atmosphere, as well as their focus on party interests.â</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">In 2022, the US Congress was brought into another paralysis,ânot byâriots, butâbyâpartisan fights. The farce of failing to elect the 118th Houseâspeaker lasted four days and a decision was only reached after 15 rounds of voting. In the last round, divisions were such that Republicans and Democrats voted strictly along party lines. <em>The New York Times</em>âwarned thatâCongress could see repeated chaos like thisâover the next two years.âBrad Bannon, president of a USâpolitical consultancy, put it bluntly,ââThe impasse inâthe US House of Representatives over the election of the Speaker is another demonstration of the decline in our political institutions.â</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">This has aroused concerns among the general public.âThe Brookings Institution concludes in a 2022âreport thatâthe once proud American democracy isâfacing a systemic crisis and isâaccelerating its decline. Theâimpactâis spreading to all frontsâinâdomestic politics,âtheâeconomy and society,âposing a mortal threat to the legitimacy and health of capitalism.âThe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace warns in a report that American democracy isâat a dangerous inflectionâpoint,âdeclining faster as the inherent ills of American capitalism worsen. Multiple challenges such as voting restrictions, electionâfraud, and loss of trust in government areâacceleratingâthe disintegration of American democracy. Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, writesâthat Americaâs dysfunctional politics raises fears that theâ2024 presidential election would again provoke deadly violence in the country. A large number of hotâbutton issues continuedâto provoke public anger and questions on the legitimacy of the US political establishment. Many worried about how long Americanâdemocracy couldâcontinue to function.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>2.âPolitical polarization intensified by partisanâfights</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">With radical factions rising in both the Democraticâand RepublicanâParties,âthe two wereâincreasingly at oddsâinâmany aspects, such asâvoter base, ideology and identity. As a result, theâtraditional inter-party balance based on policy compromise became more difficult to sustain. The two parties sawâeach other not only as political opponents, but also as a threat to the country. <em>The New York Review of Books</em> pointsâout that Americaâis already âa binational stateâ with the Republicansâand Democratsâleading two sharply opposed national communities that effectively operate as confederations under a single federal government. The United States of America hasâbecome theâdisunited states.âThe discord between âthe two Americasâ wasâdeepening day by day, and political polarization reached an unprecedented level.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Amid the escalating political battles, politicians put the interests of their political parties and factions above those of the country and acted in an unbridled way to attack and pin blames on each other.âOn 8 Augustâ2022, law enforcementâraided former President Donald Trumpâs Mar-a-Lago residence, and Trump accusedâthe Justice Department ofâplaying politics to stop his second presidential bid and of political persecution. The Republicans, on their part, were relentless on the discovery ofâclassified documents in President Joe Bidenâs residence, launched investigations into the Biden administrationâsâwithdrawal from Afghanistanâand demandedâaccountability.âUSâstate apparatus was reduced to a tool for politicalâpartiesââself-interest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Party politics increasingly followedârace and identityâlines. According to theâ<em>Financial Times</em>, Republicans are white, small town and rural while Democrats are now almost entirely urban and multi-ethnic. More than a third of Republicans and Democrats today believe violence is justified to achieve theirâpolitical ends. When oneâparty loses, its voters feel as thoughâtheir Americaâis being occupied by a foreign power. Political scientist Barbara Walterâconsidersâthe US âa factionalized anocracyâ â the halfway state between autocracy and democracy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Political polarizationâwas more of an obstacle to policy decision-making. <em>GovTrack</em>,âan online non-governmental source of legislative information and statistics, reveals a steady fall inâthe number of laws successive US Congresses could enact ââfrom 4,247 byâthe 93th to 98thâCongresses down to 2,081 byâthe 111st to 116th. The dropâwas even more pronouncedâwhen one considers how many bills could become laws,âfrom 6%âin the 106thâCongress to 1%âin the 116th, a slideâof 5 percentage points over two decades.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The tactics used in partisan fights were more scandalous.âProfessor Larry Diamond of Political Science and Sociology at Stanford University believesâthe norms of democracy, such as self-restraint in the exerciseâof power and rejection of violence, which should have been observed by the participating parties in elections, have begun disintegrating in the US.âA growing number of politicians and elected officials in the US have been willing to bend or abandon democratic norms in the quest to achieve or retain power. And as common political ground vanishes, rising proportions of Americans in both camps express attitudes and perceptions that are blinking red for democratic peril. Democracy in the US is at serious risk of breaking down.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>3.âMoney politics surged</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">âMake money yourâgod, and it will plague you like the devil,ââso admonished British playwright Henry Fielding.âIn the US, money is the breast milk of politicsâand elections increasingly morph intoâmonologues of the wealthy, while the public callâfor democracy is made onlyââa jarring noteâ.âWith theâdevilâof money lurking inâevery corner of American politics, fairness and justice is naturally strained.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Theâlatest illustration is theâ2022 midterm elections. The whole exercise has a price tagâof more than US$16.7 billionââ breaking the 2018ârecordâof US$14 billionââ as found byâReveal, an online platformâtrackingâthe flow ofâpolitical donationsâin the country. This amount dwarfsâtheâ2021âGDPsâof more than 70 countries. Federal Senate races in some states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Ohio sucked inâmore than US$100 million on average. Overâ90%âof those electedâas lawmakersâwon by splurging funds. It was impossible to identify how muchââdarkâmoneyâ, or funds from undisclosed sources, was involved.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">American politics has increasingly revealed its nature as the âgame of the richâ.âUS think tank the Brennan Center for Justiceâfinds that the top 21 families making political donations contributed at least US$15 million each, totaling US$783 million,âfar more than the US$3.7 million of small donations. Billionaires providedâ15.4%âof federal election funds, and most of itâwentâto super PACs that can accept unlimited donations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Theâenormousâbillsâdid not bringâeffective national governanceâin return. They onlyâstimulated pork barrel politics. An article on <em>Lianhe Zaobaoâobserves</em> thatâthe past few decades has witnessed a decay in Western democracy.âWealth isâincreasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, making the poor poorer and the rich richer. Politics isâcontrolled by the rich and politicians to serve their own interests. Despite aâright to vote, the public doesânotâhave real sway overâpolitics. This sense of powerlessness and loss of confidence inâpoliticalâparties and government has given rise to populism, and the problem remains unresolved.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>4.ââFreedom of speechââin name only</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The United States has always prided itself on free speech. In reality, however, freedom of speech in the United States is upheld according to self-centered âUS standardsâ. Partisan interest and money politics have become the âtwo big mountainsâ that weigh on free speech. Any speech that is detrimental to the interests of the US government or capital is subject to strict restrictions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The US government has all-encompassing regulations on media and technology companies to intervene in public opinion. In December 2022, Twitter CEO Elon Musk and journalist Matt Taibbi posted back-to-back tweets that exposed âTwitter filesâ, revealing that the US government is heavily scrutinizing all social media companies. Sometimes it directly intervenes in big media companiesâ reporting, like frequently having Google remove certain links. Twitter censored sensitive information about presidential candidates ahead of the 2020 election, creating âblacklistsâ to limit the exposure of unpopular accounts and even hot topics, and working with the FBI to monitor social media content, all the while giving the US military the green light to spread disinformation online. All this has undoubtedly torn off the fig leaf of free speech in the United States.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Capital and interest groups basically can get anything they want when it comes to public opinion. In the face of capital and interest groups,âAmerican mediaâs âfreedom of speechâ smacks of hypocrisy.âMost American mediaâfirmsâare privately owned and serve the powerful and the rich. Whether itâsâthe owner of the media or the investment and advertisement income that the media depends on, all of them are related toâcapital and interest groups. In his book The Hypocritical Superpower,âMicheal Lueders, a well-known German writer and media professional, elaboratedâin detail how the âfiltering mechanismââof American media, under theâinfluence of interest groups, chooses and distorts facts. In January 2023, Project Veritas, an American right-wing group, published a video about Pfizerâthat went viral. It recordedâJordonâTrishton Walker, a senior executive at Pfizer, sayingâthat Pfizer was exploring plans to âmutateâ the coronavirus, that the coronavirus vaccine business was a âcash cowâ, and that US regulators had vested interests inâdrug companies. To deal with the PR crisis, in addition to issuing aâstatement, Pfizer even had YouTube remove the video immediately on ground of âviolating community guidelinesâ.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The US uses social media to manipulate international public opinion. In December 2022, the independent investigation website âThe Interceptâârevealed that agencies affiliated to the US Department of Defense had long interfered in public opinion in Middle Eastern countries byâmanipulating topics and waging deceptive propaganda on social media such as Twitter. In July 2017, US Central Command official Nathaniel Kahler sent to the Twitter public policy team a form containing 52 Arabic-language accounts, asking for priority services for six of them. Following Kahlerâs request, Twitter put theseâArabic accounts on a âwhite listââto amplify messages favorable to the United States.âEric Sperling, executive director of JustâForeign Policy, an anti-war organization, commented on this incident thatâCongress and social media companies should investigate and take action to ensure that, at the very least, theâcitizens are fully informed when their tax money is being spent on putting a positive spin on theâendless wars.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">In September 2022, the explosion of the âNord Streamâ natural gas pipeline shocked the world, and the international communityâwas eager to know the identity and motive of the perpetrator. Onâ8âFebruary 2023, PulitzerâPrize-winning veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh publishedâan article exposingâthe US government as the culprit ofâthe incident. However, American and Europeanâmainstream media, known for theirâsensitivityâto such scoops,âstayed eerily quiet onâthis piece of explosiveânews. As observed by Canadian websiteâ<em>Western Standard</em>âand German televisionâchannel ZDF, Hershâs report was one of the biggest storiesâof the decade, but few media in North America wanted to talk about itâbecauseâthe West does not want anyone to find out about the truth and the surveillance technologiesâit has deployed in the Baltic Sea. Western media even try to bypass the crux of the issue by questioningâthe authenticity of Hershâs report. On 15âFebruary, Hersh wrote another article,âaccusing the US government and mainstream media of covering up the truth of the âNord Streamâ pipeline explosion. Analysts pointed out that givenâWestern mediaâs obedience to the US, theirâblocking of Hershâs revelations is not surprising.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>5.âThe judicial system blind toâpublic opinion</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">As anâinstitutionâundergirding theâcountryâs Constitution, the US Supreme Court, like the American society, has become deeply divided. Judicial powerâis hijacked by public opinion, and partisanâstruggleâhas spread to the judicial system. Increasingly, Supreme Court decisions reflect the huge chasmâbetween âtwo Americasââthe conservativesâand liberals,âand haveâbeen reduced to a tool of political warfare. Theââseparation of powersââis constantly being eroded. Partisanship has abandoned tradition and crossed the line.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Both parties pursueâtheir agenda by changing the political orientation of the Supreme Court. The presidential election has in some ways become a partisan battle for the right to appoint judges. The passing away of Supreme Courtâjustices gave Trump the opportunity to appoint during his term threeâjustices who took a conservative stance, giving conservative justices an overwhelming advantage over liberal ones. After Trump, radical white evangelical fundamentalists have taken the reins of the Supreme Court, according to an article on the South African website<em> Daily Maverick</em>. Itâs hardly surprising that the Supreme Court almost always makes decisions in favor of Christian evangelicals, big corporations and the Republican Party.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The US Supreme Courtâs decision on abortion rights fully demonstrates the consequences of being involved in partisan warfare and out of touch with society. On 24âJune 2022, the Supreme Court flagrantlyâendorsedâreligious conservatism by overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and removing constitutional protections for womenâs abortion rights. The decision triggeredâprotests across the United States. Polls show that more than half of Americans believe that stripping away abortion rights is a setback for the country. Israeli mediaââHaaretzââcommented that onâthe issue of abortion rights, the Supreme Court has underminedâdemocracyâin the name of defending it, which is a typical case of âtyrannyâof the minorityâ. Here is an unrepresentative Supreme Court, with itsâjustices appointed by an unrepresentative presidentâandâconfirmed by an obviouslyâunrepresentative Senate; but it has made a decision that will affect the United States till 2030, 2040, and even 2050.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The Supreme Court also struck down a New York state law that had been in place since 1913 restricting people from carrying concealed firearms. As the nation reflects on gun violence, such a reckless reversal of New Yorkâs gun control law is intolerable,ânoted the governor of New York. American political commentator Matthew Dowd pointedâout that the problems facing the United States today are rooted in the fragmentation of democracy. What American citizens want are a fair ruling in Roe v. Wade, a real gun reform, higher minimum wages, steeperâtaxes on the super-rich, betterâhealth care for all, and other reforms that heed popular calls.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>6.âAmericansâincreasingly disillusioned with American democracy</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Americansââpride in their democracy has dropped sharply, from 90%âin 2002 to 54%âin 2022, according to a joint Washington Post-University of Maryland survey. Aâpoll by theâPublic Policy Institute of Californiaâshows thatâCalifornianâvoters have widespread concern that American democracy is goingâoff track, with 62%âsaying the country is headed in the wrong direction, 46%âpessimistic about the prospect of Americans with different political views working together to resolve differences, and 52%âdissatisfied with the current way American democracy works. According to aâQuinnipiac University poll, 67%âof respondents believe that American democracy is in danger of collapse, and 48%âthink there could be anotherâCapitol riot in the United States. According to aâPew Center poll, 65%âof Americans believe that the American democratic system needs major reforms, while 57%âof respondents believe the United States is no longer a model of democracy. AâUCLA study shows that the US government has been losing its ability to govern and its sense of democratic responsibility in recent years, and lacks effective measures to push forward large-scale reformsâorâaddress issues such as electoral justice and media fraud.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>III. The United Statesâ imposition ofââdemocracyâ hasâcaused chaos around the world</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">In spite of all the problems facing its own democracy, the United States refuses toâreflect on itself, but instead continues to export American democratic values to other countries,âand use the pretext of democracy to oppress other countries and serve its own agenda. What the US has done is exacerbating division in the international community and bloc-based confrontation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>1. Foreign policy held hostage by political polarization</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">âPolitics stops at the waterâs edgeâ is a popular proverb in American political circles, which means that partisan struggle should be confined to domestic politics and that a united front should be formed when dealing withâforeign affairs. However, with the intensification of political polarization, Democrats and Republicans are increasingly divided on major foreign affairsâissues, and Americaâsâforeign policy has become more and more âextremeâ. âPolitics crossing the waterâs edgeâ has become the norm. It is not only harmful to many developing countries, but also poses a threat to Americaâs own allies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the Trump administration and some extreme politicians have concocted all kinds of lies and rumors against China on coronavirus origins-tracing. The most typical is in 2021, when the US intelligence agency issued the so-called origins-tracingâreport, which, in total disregard of science, fabricated the âlab leakâ storyâand claimed that China lacked transparency and obstructed international investigations. Tracing the origins of the coronavirus is a matter of science, butâthe true purpose of the USâ doing is to obscure the views of the public and manipulate the issue to shift the blame ontoâChina and suppress and contain China. This fully exposes the hypocrisy of American democracy and the ill effectsâof political polarization.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Under the Biden administration, the US ended 20 years of war in Afghanistanâwith a hasty withdrawal of troops. It just walked away, after shatteringâa whole countryâandâdestroyingâthe future of several generations. Although its troops have left, the US government continued toâsanctionâAfghanistan, and illegally froze the assets of the Afghan central bank, making life even worse for the local people.âAâUN-backed report published in May 2022 showedâthat nearly 20 million people in Afghanistan were facing acute hunger. Even after the devastating earthquake in Afghanistan in June 2022, the US still refused to lift the sanctions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Political polarization in the US is spilling over. According to a report released by the University of Ottawa,âthere is open support from conservative media, including Fox News, and conservative politicians in the US for the far-right extremists in Canada. It represents a greater threat to Canadian democracy than the actions of any other state, and the implications of democratic backsliding in the US forâCanadaâmust be reflected upon. Professor Gordon Laxer at the University of Alberta believes the forces moving the USâtoward autocracy already exist. It is ingrained among Canadians that the US is their greatest friend and will always champion democracy.âThat can no longer be taken for granted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>2.âInciting confrontation and conflictâin the name of democracy</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Democracy is a common value ofâhumanity and must not be used as a tool to advance geopolitical agendaâor counter human development and progress. However, in order to maintain its hegemony, the USâhas long been monopolizing the definition of âdemocracyâ,âinstigating division and confrontationâin the name of democracy, and undermining the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Since its outbreak in early 2022, the Ukraine crisisâhas hit the countryâs economy and the livelihood of its people hard. In October 2022, the World Bank released a report suggesting that Ukraine would need at least US$349 billion, or 1.5 times the countryâs total economic output for the whole year of 2021,âto rebuild after the war.âThe US saw the Ukraine crisis as aâlucrative opportunity. Instead of taking any measures conducive to ending hostilities, the US kept fueling the flames and made a huge fortune from the war business including the arms industry and the energy sector. It described its arms supply to Ukraine as a move to support âdemocracy versus authoritarianismâ. A July 2022âreport byâSerbiaâs Center for Strategic Prognosis pointed out that the US saw Russiaâs 1999 attack on Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, as a crime, but called a similar American operation in Fallujah, an Iraqi city about the size of Grozny, liberation. Americaâs so-called democracy has long been hijacked by interest groups and capital, and brought instability and chaos to the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">In August 2022, then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a provocative visit to Chinaâs Taiwan regionâin disregard of Chinaâs firm opposition and serious representations. It was a major political provocation that upgraded official contact between the USâand Taiwan, and aggravated tensions across the Taiwan Strait. Yet, Pelosi argued that the visit âhonors Americaâs unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwanâs vibrant democracyâ. The crux of Pelosiâs provocative visit is not about democracy, but Chinaâs sovereignty and territorial integrity. The US action was by no means defending or preserving democracy, but challenging and violating Chinaâs sovereignty and territorial integrity. Pelosiâs fallacy was unbearable even to some US politicians. Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Greene challenged Pelosi, saying that âAmericans have had enough with a woman obsessed with her own power sheâs held for decades while our entire country crumbles ... Enough of this fake âcourageâ defending democracy.â</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The international community is seeing the US approach more and more clearly. Dmitry Medvedev,âDeputy Chairmanâof the Security Council of the Russian Federation, wrote that the US, as a self-proclaimed âhigh priestâ, has wreaked havoc around the world under the disguise of âtrue democracyâ, and used money, allies and high-end weapons to crudely impose its will. An article published on Ahram Online, an Egyptian news website, argued that âliberalismâ and âdemocracyâ had been turned intoâa weaponized ideology that the US uses to destabilize other countries, delegitimize their governments, and intervene with forms of sociopolitical engineering that often backfires in drastic ways. None of it has to do with the liberalism, democracy and freedom the US claims to promote.âChairman of the Indonesian Peopleâs Wave PartyâAnis Mattaâpointed out that American cleverness is making other countries a battlefield. Anti-China sentiment and polarization in Indonesia are also Americaâs work. Muslims must understand that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>3.âDoubling down on unilateral sanctions</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Under the pretext of human rights and democracy, the USâhas long been using unilateral sanctions and âlong-arm jurisdictionâ against other countries based on its domestic laws and its own values. In the past decades, the USâimposed unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction on Cuba, Belarus, Syria, Zimbabwe and other countries, placed maximum pressure on countries including the DPRK, Iranâand Venezuela, and unilaterally froze US$130 million in military aid to Egypt under the excuse of the countryâs lack of progress in human rights.âSuch actions have seriously damaged the economic development and peopleâs livelihood in the countriesâconcerned, and jeopardizedâthe right to life, the right to self-determinationâand the right to development, constitutingâa continual, systematic and massive violation of human rights in other countries. In recent years, US unilateral sanctionsâhave been increasing and its âlong armâ has been extendingâfurther. In order to preserve its hegemony, the US has wilfullyâharmed the interests of other countries, especially the legitimate and lawful interests of developing countries, in disregard of international law and the basic norms of international relations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">An article published by the Turkish Anadolu News Agency in March 2022 argued that in the name of promoting democracy, the US invaded Iraq on unsubstantiated grounds and brought immense sufferings to the local population. First, the abuse of sanctions aggravated livelihoodâchallenges. Between 1990 and 2003, the severe economic sanctions by the US took a heavy toll on the local economy and the well-being of the Iraqi people. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization,âthe hunger rate in Iraq reached a very high level as a result of the US sanctions and embargo. Between 1990 and 1995 alone, 500,000 Iraqi children died of hunger and poor living conditions. Second, the incessantâwar caused enormous civilian casualties. According to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, about 120,000 Iraqi civilians were killed between 2003, when the US started the Iraq War,âand 2011, when the US announced its withdrawal. Third, theâimposed political model failed to adapt. The US forced the American-style democracy upon Iraq in disregardâof the latterâs national conditions, only to aggravate the political fight between different factions in the country.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The unilateral sanctions imposed by the US fully demonstrate its arrogance and indifference toward humanitarianism. On 11 Februaryâ2022, President Biden signed an executive order to split in half the US$7 billion in Afghan central bankâassets frozen in the US. Half of the assets were to fund financial compensations for 9/11 victims, and the other half were transferred to an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Such blatant stealing from the Afghan people has been widely condemned by the international community. SINDOnews.com, a news website of Indonesia, reported in March 2022 that people of Afghan descent rallied at the US Embassy in Jakarta to protest the US governmentâs looting ofâassetsâfrom the Afghan government. The indignant protesters argued that the assets of the former Afghan government belonged to the Afghan peopleâand should be used to aid the Afghan people who were experiencing an economic crisis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>4. Undermining democracy in international relations</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">International affairs bear on theâcommon interests of mankind, and should be conducted through consultation by all countries. Yet,âthe US has never truly observed the principle of democracy in international relations. Under the pretext of âmultilateralismââand âinternational rulesâ,âand clinging to theâCold War mentality, the USâhas exercised fake multilateralism and bloc politics, instigatedâdivision and antagonism, createdâbloc confrontation, and practiced unilateralism in the name of multilateralism. Its hegemonic, domineering and bullying acts seriously impede the development of true multilateralism.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The USâplaces its domestic law above international law, and adopts a selective approach to international rules, applying and discarding such rules as it sees fit. Since the 1980s, the US has withdrawn from 17 important international organizations or agreements, including the UN Human Rights Council, WHO, UNESCO, the Paris Agreement on climate change, the JCPOA, the Arms Trade Treaty, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treatyâand the Treaty on Open Skies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">The US flagrantly violates the purposesâand principles of the UN Charter and the basic norms governing international relations, waging wars and creating division and conflictâacross the world. Throughout its historyâof 240-plus years, the US has been at peace for only 16 yearsââ it is indeed the most belligerent country in world history. Since the end of World War II, the US has waged or participated in many wars overseas, including the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War, which caused immenseâcivilian casualties and property lossesâas well asâhumanitarian catastrophes. Since 2001, the wars and military operations that the USâlaunched in the name of fighting terrorism have killed more than 900,000 people, including some 335,000 civilians, injured millions and displaced tens of millions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Paying no heed to theâ<em>United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</em>âandâprinciples of international law, or toâthe democratic rightsâofâAsia-Pacific countriesâand Pacific island countries in regional and international affairs,âthe US has emboldenedâJapan by expressly supporting its decision to discharge the nuclear waste water from Fukushima, even thoughâthe government of Japan has not yet fully consultedâstakeholders and relevant international agenciesâon the disposal,ânot yet provided sufficient scientific and factual grounds for its behavior, andânot yet addressedâthe legitimate concernsâof the international community. On the other hand, the US administration, citing âradionuclide contaminationâ,âbanned the import of Japanese food and agricultural products fromâareas around Fukushima, exposing the hypocrisy of typical US-style double standards.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Advancingâthe Cold War mentality in the South Pacific region, the âUS has ganged upâwith the UKâand Australia to putâtogether AUKUS, a racist clique, and pledged to help Australia build at least eight nuclear submarines together with theâUK. The move constitutes a serious violation of the principles of the <em>Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsâand theâSouth Pacific NuclearâFree ZoneâTreaty</em>, treading a reckless line on the brink of nuclear proliferationâand creating tremendous risks.âIt has also openedâtheâPandoraâs boxâof regional arms race, casting a shadow over regional peace, security and stability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Prior toâthe ninth Summit of the Americasâin June 2022, Julio Yao, a Panamanian expert on international issues, wrote in local media that todayâs US is an absoluteârenegadeâofâinternational law, and the most genuinely authentic personification of the use of brute force in international relations. The USâis the only country that has not signed or ratified anyâhuman rights treaty,âand is not a party to theâ<em>United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</em>. Itâis the only country that does not ban secret biological weapons, with more than 200 laboratories outside its borders. The only thing that the US intends to do with the Summit of the Americas is to involveâLatin Americaâand the Caribbeanâinâthe war in Ukraine and to divide and weaken them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">In August 2022, aâ<em>South China Morning Post</em>âarticleânoted that the so-called âdemocraciesâ of the US and the West have been relentlessly chipping away at the foundations of international rules and exploiting them when itâs convenient. While the US and the West denounce Russiaâs âinvasionâ of Ukraine, they forget their serial interventions, subversions and interference across the globe. What the US did has smashed up the world economy, thereby exposing more middle-income countries to debt crises. When the big powers are selective in following the rules they wrote, the whole system loses credibility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>5. Foisting a trumped-up narrative of âdemocracy versus authoritarianismââ</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Harboring the Cold War mentality, a hegemonic logic and a preference for bloc politics, the US administration has framed a narrative of âdemocracy versus authoritarianismâ, and labeled countries as âautocraciesâ, with a view to using ideology and values as a tool to suppress other countries and advance its own geostrategyâunder the disguise of democracy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">In 2021, the USâheldâthe firstââSummit for Democracyâ, attempting to divide the international community into so-called âdemocratic and undemocratic campsââby openly drawing an ideological line. The move drewâquestionsâextensively, includingâfrom withinâthe US. Both <em>Foreign Affairsâand The Diplomat</em>âcarried articlesâcriticizing the summit as chasingâthe wrong goal, not only failing to achieve unity among democratic countries, but also drawing criticism for the representation issue. The USâhas long lacked a set goal in its promotion of democracy around the world, and has been slow in following up itsârhetoric. Whenâdemocracy in the US is in such a mess, holding a democracy summit cannot boost democracy around the world, but moreâlikely create a greater geopolitical crisis. Hitoshi Tanaka, Chairman of the Institute for International Strategy of Japan, pointed out that the US has been imposing âdemocracyââon other countries, advancing the âdemocracy versus authoritarianismââcampaign, and expanding global division. Japan should not blindly follow suit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">To brand oneselfâas democracy whileâothers as autocraciesâis in itself an act contrary to democracy. The so-called âdemocracy versus authoritarianismâ narrative does not reflect the realities of todayâs world, nor is it in line with the trend of the times. âBelarusâ1â, aâstate televisionâstation of Belarus,âcommented thatâthe listâof participantsâto the summit was clearly based on the US standard of âfreedomâ,âbut the question was how couldâthe USâbelieve thatâit could monopolize the definition and interpretationâof democracy, and tell others what democracy should look like.âSingaporeâs <em>Straits Times</em>âcarried a column that saidâthe US must realize that American democracy has lost its former luster, and is no longer the gold standard. There is no fixed model of democracy, and the US no longer has an absolute say over what democracy means. That is the truth. The US should pragmatically reassess its diplomatic methods and focus on cooperation instead of confrontation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Despite unprecedentedly low ratings of US democracy at home and abroad, the countryâs hysteriaâto export US-styleâdemocracy and valuesâcontinues unabated. The USâhas not only cobbled together values-based alliancesâsuch asâAUKUS, the Quad and the Five Eyes, but alsoâattemptedâto disrupt and undermineânormal international cooperationâin economy, trade, science, technology, cultureâand people-to-people exchanges by drawing ideological lines and trumpetingâtheâCold War mentality.âAl Jazeeraâobservedâthat the USâinsistence on holding a democracy summit and acting as a global democratic leader evenâwhen trust in its ownâdemocratic system is decliningâhas raisedâwidespread suspicion. James Goldgeier,âprofessor of international relations atâAmerican University, said the USâhas lostâitsâcredibility,âand that its administration should hold a domestic democracy summit to focus on injustice and inequality, including issues such as voting rights and disinformation. Emma Ashford, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, questionedâhow can the US spread democracy or act as an example for others if it barely has a functioning democracy at home. The <em>South China Morning Post</em>âpointed out that the summit reflected two myths about US democracy: First, global advance of democracyâsince the end of the Cold Warâis backsliding and it needs the US to reverse it; second, the US is the most important democracy in the worldâand its global leadership is paramount for other countries. These two myths completely ignore the democratic backsliding in the US, the rejection of the overwhelming majority of countriesâto beingâkidnapped by theâhypocritical âconcept of democracyâ of the US, and the strong desire of developing countries to grow theirâeconomiesâand raise living standards.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>IV. Conclusion</strong></p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Democracy is humanityâsâcommon value; however, there is no single model of political system that is applicable to all countries in the world. Human civilization, if compared to a garden, should be a diverse place in which democracy in different countries blooms like a hundred flowers.âThe USâhas American-style democracy, China has Chinese-style democracy, and other countriesâhave theirâown unique modelsâof democracy that suitâtheir respectiveânational conditions. It should be up to the people of a country to judge whether theâcountry is democratic or not and how to better promote democracyâin their country. The few self-righteous countries have no right to point fingers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Those who have many flaws themselves have little credibility to lecture others. Attempts to undermine others for oneâs own profit and destabilize the world must be unanimously opposed. A black-and-white division of countries as democraticâorâauthoritarian is both anachronistic and arbitrary. Whatâour world needs today is not to stokeâdivision in the name of democracy andâpursue de facto supremacy-orientedâunilateralism, but to strengthen solidarity and cooperation and uphold true multilateralismâon the basis of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Whatâour world needs today is notâto interfere in other countriesââinternal affairs under the guise of democracy, but to advocate genuine democracy, rejectâpseudo-democracy and jointly promoteâgreater democracy in international relations. Whatâour world needs today is not a âSummit for Democracyâ that hypes upâconfrontation and contributes nothing to the collective response to global challenges, but a conference of solidarity that focuses on taking real actions to solve prominent global challenges.</p><p style="text-indent: 0px;">Freedom, democracy and human rights are the common pursuit of humanity,âand values that the Communist Party of Chinaâ(CPC) always pursues. China commitsâto and advancesâwhole-processâpeopleâs democracy, andâputs into action the principle of people running theâcountry in the CPCâs exercise of national governance in specific and concrete ways. Chinaâstands readyâto strengthen exchanges and mutual learning with other countries on the issue of democracy, advocateâhumanityâs common values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, promote greater democracy in international relations, and make new and greater contributions toâhuman progress.</p></div>
